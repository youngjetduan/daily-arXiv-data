Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedeCouple是一种联邦学习方法，通过细粒度平衡全局泛化与局部适应性，联合学习全局和局部特征表示，使用动态知识蒸馏增强个性化分类器的泛化能力，并通过锚点优化特征空间，在保护隐私的同时提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化联邦学习方法主要关注特征空间一致性和分类个性化，但忽视了提取器的局部适应性和分类器的全局泛化性，导致组件间协调不足、耦合弱，最终降低整体模型性能。

Method: 提出FedeCouple方法：1）联合学习全局和局部特征表示；2）使用动态知识蒸馏增强个性化分类器的泛化能力；3）引入锚点优化特征空间，锚点的严格局部性和非传输特性保护隐私并减少通信开销。

Result: 在五个图像分类数据集上的实验表明，FedeCouple在有效性、稳定性、可扩展性和安全性方面持续优于九种基线方法。在有效性评估实验中，FedeCouple比最佳基线方法显著高出4.3%。

Conclusion: FedeCouple通过细粒度平衡全局泛化与局部适应性，有效解决了联邦学习中组件协调不足的问题，理论分析证明其在非凸目标下收敛，实验验证了其优越性能。

Abstract: In privacy-preserving mobile network transmission scenarios with heterogeneous client data, personalized federated learning methods that decouple feature extractors and classifiers have demonstrated notable advantages in enhancing learning capability. However, many existing approaches primarily focus on feature space consistency and classification personalization during local training, often neglecting the local adaptability of the extractor and the global generalization of the classifier. This oversight results in insufficient coordination and weak coupling between the components, ultimately degrading the overall model performance. To address this challenge, we propose FedeCouple, a federated learning method that balances global generalization and local adaptability at a fine-grained level. Our approach jointly learns global and local feature representations while employing dynamic knowledge distillation to enhance the generalization of personalized classifiers. We further introduce anchors to refine the feature space; their strict locality and non-transmission inherently preserve privacy and reduce communication overhead. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis proving that FedeCouple converges for nonconvex objectives, with iterates approaching a stationary point as the number of communication rounds increases. Extensive experiments conducted on five image-classification datasets demonstrate that FedeCouple consistently outperforms nine baseline methods in effectiveness, stability, scalability, and security. Notably, in experiments evaluating effectiveness, FedeCouple surpasses the best baseline by a significant margin of 4.3%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有思维感知生成方法虽然旨在提升复杂任务性能，但存在关键失败模式：顺序自回归方法由于错误传播反而会降低性能。需要系统分析这一问题并开发更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 提出并行多模态扩散框架MMaDA-Parallel，支持文本和图像在整个去噪轨迹中的连续双向交互。首先进行监督微调，然后通过新颖的并行强化学习策略进行优化，该策略沿轨迹应用语义奖励来强制跨模态一致性。

Conclusion: MMaDA-Parallel为思维感知图像合成建立了一个更鲁棒的范式，通过并行交互机制有效解决了顺序自回归方法中的错误传播问题。

Abstract: While thinking-aware generation aims to improve performance on complex tasks, we identify a critical failure mode where existing sequential, autoregressive approaches can paradoxically degrade performance due to error propagation. To systematically analyze this issue, we propose ParaBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate both text and image output modalities. Our analysis using ParaBench reveals that this performance degradation is strongly correlated with poor alignment between the generated reasoning and the final image. To resolve this, we propose a parallel multimodal diffusion framework, MMaDA-Parallel, that enables continuous, bidirectional interaction between text and images throughout the entire denoising trajectory. MMaDA-Parallel is trained with supervised finetuning and then further optimized by Parallel Reinforcement Learning (ParaRL), a novel strategy that applies semantic rewards along the trajectory to enforce cross-modal consistency. Experiments validate that our model significantly improves cross-modal alignment and semantic consistency, achieving a 6.9\% improvement in Output Alignment on ParaBench compared to the state-of-the-art model, Bagel, establishing a more robust paradigm for thinking-aware image synthesis.

TL;DR: 提出首个从声带图像自动分类语音创伤严重程度的方法，采用序数回归框架处理有序标签，并引入软标签处理标注不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音创伤严重程度评估依赖临床专家判断，成本高且可靠性差异大，需要自动化工具来支持大规模研究和改善患者护理。

Method: 采用序数回归框架处理有序标签，提出新颖的软序数回归损失函数，能够处理反映标注者评分分布的软标签。

Result: 所提出的软序数回归方法在预测性能上接近临床专家水平，同时产生良好校准的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: 该自动化工具能够实现语音创伤严重程度的大规模研究，最终改善临床理解和患者护理。

Abstract: Phonotrauma refers to vocal fold tissue damage resulting from exposure to forces during voicing. It occurs on a continuum from mild to severe, and treatment options can vary based on severity. Assessment of severity involves a clinician's expert judgment, which is costly and can vary widely in reliability. In this work, we present the first method for automatically classifying phonotrauma severity from vocal fold images. To account for the ordinal nature of the labels, we adopt a widely used ordinal regression framework. To account for label uncertainty, we propose a novel modification to ordinal regression loss functions that enables them to operate on soft labels reflecting annotator rating distributions. Our proposed soft ordinal regression method achieves predictive performance approaching that of clinical experts, while producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. By providing an automated tool for phonotrauma severity assessment, our work can enable large-scale studies of phonotrauma, ultimately leading to improved clinical understanding and patient care.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SliderEdit是一个用于基于指令的图像编辑的连续控制框架，通过解耦多指令提示中的各个指令并为每个指令提供可调节的滑块，实现精细化的编辑强度控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于指令的图像编辑模型对多指令提示中的每个指令使用固定强度，限制了用户对单个编辑强度的精确和连续控制能力。

Method: SliderEdit框架将多部分编辑指令解耦，为每个指令训练全局滑块，使用单一低秩适应矩阵集来泛化处理各种编辑、属性和组合指令，实现连续插值控制。

Result: 将SliderEdit应用于FLUX-Kontext和Qwen-Image-Edit等先进图像编辑模型，显著提高了编辑可控性、视觉一致性和用户可操控性。

Conclusion: SliderEdit是首个探索和提出在基于指令的图像编辑模型中实现连续、精细化指令控制的框架，为交互式、指令驱动的图像操作铺平了道路。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing models have recently achieved impressive performance, enabling complex edits to an input image from a multi-instruction prompt. However, these models apply each instruction in the prompt with a fixed strength, limiting the user's ability to precisely and continuously control the intensity of individual edits. We introduce SliderEdit, a framework for continuous image editing with fine-grained, interpretable instruction control. Given a multi-part edit instruction, SliderEdit disentangles the individual instructions and exposes each as a globally trained slider, allowing smooth adjustment of its strength. Unlike prior works that introduced slider-based attribute controls in text-to-image generation, typically requiring separate training or fine-tuning for each attribute or concept, our method learns a single set of low-rank adaptation matrices that generalize across diverse edits, attributes, and compositional instructions. This enables continuous interpolation along individual edit dimensions while preserving both spatial locality and global semantic consistency. We apply SliderEdit to state-of-the-art image editing models, including FLUX-Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit, and observe substantial improvements in edit controllability, visual consistency, and user steerability. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore and propose a framework for continuous, fine-grained instruction control in instruction-based image editing models. Our results pave the way for interactive, instruction-driven image manipulation with continuous and compositional control.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了视频群体密度估计的挑战，提供了一个在保持准确性的同时降低计算负担的实用解决方案，适用于实时监控应用。

Abstract: This study enhances a crowd density estimation algorithm originally designed for image-based analysis by adapting it for video-based scenarios. The proposed method integrates a denoising probabilistic model that utilizes diffusion processes to generate high-quality crowd density maps. To improve accuracy, narrow Gaussian kernels are employed, and multiple density map outputs are generated. A regression branch is incorporated into the model for precise feature extraction, while a consolidation mechanism combines these maps based on similarity scores to produce a robust final result. An event-driven sampling technique, utilizing the Farneback optical flow algorithm, is introduced to selectively capture frames showing significant crowd movements, reducing computational load and storage by focusing on critical crowd dynamics. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, including overlay plots and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the model demonstrates its ability to effectively capture crowd dynamics in both dense and sparse settings. The efficiency of the sampling method is further assessed, showcasing its capability to decrease frame counts while maintaining essential crowd events. By addressing the temporal challenges unique to video analysis, this work offers a scalable and efficient framework for real-time crowd monitoring in applications such as public safety, disaster response, and event management.

Motivation: 解决传统视觉定位方法在室内环境中受限于智能手机LiDAR短距离和室内布局模糊性的问题，为紧急响应和辅助导航等应用提供更可靠的定位方案。

Method: 使用基础单目深度估计模型从姿态RGB图像重建尺度对齐的3D点云，然后通过卷积与平面图进行几何布局匹配，输出位置和方向的后验分布。

Conclusion: PALMS+展示了在无基础设施应用中用于无摄像头跟踪的鲁棒性，为室内定位提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Indoor localization in GPS-denied environments is crucial for applications like emergency response and assistive navigation. Vision-based methods such as PALMS enable infrastructure-free localization using only a floor plan and a stationary scan, but are limited by the short range of smartphone LiDAR and ambiguity in indoor layouts. We propose PALMS$+$, a modular, image-based system that addresses these challenges by reconstructing scale-aligned 3D point clouds from posed RGB images using a foundation monocular depth estimation model (Depth Pro), followed by geometric layout matching via convolution with the floor plan. PALMS$+$ outputs a posterior over the location and orientation, usable for direct or sequential localization. Evaluated on the Structured3D and a custom campus dataset consisting of 80 observations across four large campus buildings, PALMS$+$ outperforms PALMS and F3Loc in stationary localization accuracy -- without requiring any training. Furthermore, when integrated with a particle filter for sequential localization on 33 real-world trajectories, PALMS$+$ achieved lower localization errors compared to other methods, demonstrating robustness for camera-free tracking and its potential for infrastructure-free applications.

Conclusion: 动态占用空间损失函数能有效指导模型学习避免现实碰撞，同时提高轨迹预测精度，在不同人群密度条件下均表现优异。

Abstract: In dynamic and crowded environments, realistic pedestrian trajectory prediction remains a challenging task due to the complex nature of human motion and the mutual influences among individuals. Deep learning models have recently achieved promising results by implicitly learning such patterns from 2D trajectory data. However, most approaches treat pedestrians as point entities, ignoring the physical space that each person occupies. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model that enhances the Social LSTM with a new Dynamic Occupied Space loss function. This loss function guides Social LSTM in learning to avoid realistic collisions without increasing displacement error across different crowd densities, ranging from low to high, in both homogeneous and heterogeneous density settings. Such a function achieves this by combining the average displacement error with a new collision penalty that is sensitive to scene density and individual spatial occupancy. For efficient training and evaluation, five datasets were generated from real pedestrian trajectories recorded during the Festival of Lights in Lyon 2022. Four datasets represent homogeneous crowd conditions -- low, medium, high, and very high density -- while the fifth corresponds to a heterogeneous density distribution. The experimental findings indicate that the proposed model not only lowers collision rates but also enhances displacement prediction accuracy in each dataset. Specifically, the model achieves up to a 31% reduction in the collision rate and reduces the average displacement error and the final displacement error by 5% and 6%, respectively, on average across all datasets compared to the baseline. Moreover, the proposed model consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art deep learning models across most test sets.

Abstract: Soiling detection for automotive cameras is a crucial part of advanced driver assistance systems to make them more robust to external conditions like weather, dust, etc. In this paper, we regard the soiling detection as a semantic segmentation problem. We provide a comprehensive comparison of popular segmentation methods and show their superiority in performance while comparing them to tile-level classification approaches. Moreover, we present an extensive analysis of the Woodscape dataset showing that the original dataset contains a data-leakage and imprecise annotations. To address these problems, we create a new data subset, which, despite being much smaller, provides enough information for the segmentation method to reach comparable results in a much shorter time.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了8个医学和通用领域基础模型在胸部X光分析中的表现，发现医学领域预训练在特征质量上有显著优势，但特征效用高度依赖任务。对于复杂病理分割，所有基础模型都需要大量微调，监督模型仍是强有力替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在医学影像中的有效性存在差异，预训练领域、范式和架构对嵌入质量的影响尚不明确，这阻碍了为特定放射学任务选择最佳编码器。

Method: 评估8个医学和通用领域基础模型的视觉编码器，使用线性探测和微调对胸部X光进行分类（气胸、心脏肥大）和分割（气胸、心脏边界）任务。

Result: 医学领域预训练具有显著优势，在线性探测中表现优于通用模型。预训练嵌入在全局分类和显著解剖结构分割中表现良好，但在复杂病理分割中表现不佳。文本-图像对齐不是必要条件，监督端到端基线在分割任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 医学预训练有益，但架构选择（如多尺度）至关重要，预训练特征并非普遍有效，特别是在复杂定位任务中，监督模型仍是强有力替代方案。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) promise to generalize medical imaging, but their effectiveness varies. It remains unclear how pre-training domain (medical vs. general), paradigm (e.g., text-guided), and architecture influence embedding quality, hindering the selection of optimal encoders for specific radiology tasks. To address this, we evaluate vision encoders from eight medical and general-domain FMs for chest X-ray analysis. We benchmark classification (pneumothorax, cardiomegaly) and segmentation (pneumothorax, cardiac boundary) using linear probing and fine-tuning. Our results show that domain-specific pre-training provides a significant advantage; medical FMs consistently outperformed general-domain models in linear probing, establishing superior initial feature quality. However, feature utility is highly task-dependent. Pre-trained embeddings were strong for global classification and segmenting salient anatomy (e.g., heart). In contrast, for segmenting complex, subtle pathologies (e.g., pneumothorax), all FMs performed poorly without significant fine-tuning, revealing a critical gap in localizing subtle disease. Subgroup analysis showed FMs use confounding shortcuts (e.g., chest tubes for pneumothorax) for classification, a strategy that fails for precise segmentation. We also found that expensive text-image alignment is not a prerequisite; image-only (RAD-DINO) and label-supervised (Ark+) FMs were among top performers. Notably, a supervised, end-to-end baseline remained highly competitive, matching or exceeding the best FMs on segmentation tasks. These findings show that while medical pre-training is beneficial, architectural choices (e.g., multi-scale) are critical, and pre-trained features are not universally effective, especially for complex localization tasks where supervised models remain a strong alternative.

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1) 上下文对象描述指导定位；2) 自交叉注意力机制识别候选区域；3) 分割模型生成精确掩码用于姿态估计。关键创新是自动重新注册机制，通过特征相似性监测检测跟踪失败并从严重遮挡中恢复。

Result: 在具有多目标遮挡、高速运动和变化光照的挑战性工业数据集上达到最先进精度，同时以实时速度运行且无需额外训练。

Conclusion: 这种无标注方法显著减少了部署开销，为柔性制造和智能质量控制等现代应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation and tracking are fundamental capabilities for physical AI systems such as robots. However, existing approaches typically rely on a manually annotated segmentation mask of the target in the first frame, which is labor-intensive and leads to reduced performance when faced with occlusions or rapid movement. To address these limi- tations, we propose STORM (Segment, Track, and Object Re-localization from a single 3D Model), an open-source robust real-time 6D pose estimation system that requires no manual annotation. STORM employs a novel three-stage pipeline combining vision-language understanding with self-supervised feature matching: contextual object descriptions guide localization, self-cross-attention mechanisms identify candidate regions, and a segmentation model produces precise masks for accurate pose estimation. Another key innovation is our automatic re-registration mechanism that detects tracking failures through feature similarity monitoring and recovers from severe occlusions or rapid motion. STORM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging industrial datasets featuring multi-object occlusions, high-speed motion, and varying illumination, while operating at real-time speeds without additional training. This annotation-free approach significantly reduces deployment overhead, providing a practical solution for modern applications, such as flexible manufacturing and intelligent quality control.

Conclusion: PANDA框架有效解决了现实世界数据流的双级不平衡问题，能够无缝集成到现有基于预训练模型的无示例持续学习方法中，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Exemplar-Free Continual Learning (EFCL) restricts the storage of previous task data and is highly susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. While pre-trained models (PTMs) are increasingly leveraged for EFCL, existing methods often overlook the inherent imbalance of real-world data distributions. We discovered that real-world data streams commonly exhibit dual-level imbalances, dataset-level distributions combined with extreme or reversed skews within individual tasks, creating both intra-task and inter-task disparities that hinder effective learning and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose PANDA, a Patch-and-Distribution-Aware Augmentation framework that integrates seamlessly with existing PTM-based EFCL methods. PANDA amplifies low-frequency classes by using a CLIP encoder to identify representative regions and transplanting those into frequent-class samples within each task. Furthermore, PANDA incorporates an adaptive balancing strategy that leverages prior task distributions to smooth inter-task imbalances, reducing the overall gap between average samples across tasks and enabling fairer learning with frozen PTMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate PANDA's capability to work with existing PTM-based CL methods, improving accuracy and reducing catastrophic forgetting.

Result: STS在标准评估协议下大幅超越或与最先进的测试时适应方法相媲美，仅引入少量额外参数，推理速度比传统测试时提示调优快8倍，内存占用小12倍。

Conclusion: STS提供了一种高效且轻量级的测试时适应解决方案，在保持高性能的同时显著减少了计算和内存需求。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at zero-shot inference but often degrade under test-time domain shifts. For this reason, episodic test-time adaptation strategies have recently emerged as powerful techniques for adapting VLMs to a single unlabeled image. However, existing adaptation strategies, such as test-time prompt tuning, typically require backpropagating through large encoder weights or altering core model components. In this work, we introduce Spectrum-Aware Test-Time Steering (STS), a lightweight adaptation framework that extracts a spectral subspace from the textual embeddings to define principal semantic directions and learns to steer latent representations in a spectrum-aware manner by adapting a small number of per-sample shift parameters to minimize entropy across augmented views. STS operates entirely at inference in the latent space, without backpropagation through or modification of the frozen encoders. Building on standard evaluation protocols, our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that STS largely surpasses or compares favorably against state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods, while introducing only a handful of additional parameters and achieving inference speeds up to 8x faster with a 12x smaller memory footprint than conventional test-time prompt tuning.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for animating humans in 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a neural scene representation that has recently achieved state-of-the-art photorealistic results for novel-view synthesis but remains under-explored for human-scene animation and interaction. Unlike existing animation pipelines that use meshes or point clouds as the underlying 3D representation, our approach introduces the use of 3DGS as the 3D representation to the problem of animating humans in scenes. By representing humans and scenes as Gaussians, our approach allows for geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of humans interacting with 3D scenes. Our key insight is that the rendering can be decoupled from the motion synthesis and each sub-problem can be addressed independently, without the need for paired human-scene data. Central to our method is a Gaussian-aligned motion module that synthesizes motion without explicit scene geometry, using opacity-based cues and projected Gaussian structures to guide human placement and pose alignment. To ensure natural interactions, we further propose a human-scene Gaussian refinement optimization that enforces realistic contact and navigation. We evaluate our approach on scenes from Scannet++ and the SuperSplat library, and on avatars reconstructed from sparse and dense multi-view human capture. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework allows for novel applications such as geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of edited monocular RGB videos with new animated humans, showcasing the unique advantage of 3DGS for monocular video-based human animation.

TL;DR: CertMask是一种可证明鲁棒的防御方法，通过单轮掩码操作有效对抗对抗性补丁攻击，相比现有方法显著降低计算复杂度并提升认证鲁棒精度。

Motivation: 对抗性补丁攻击通过局部扰动误导深度视觉模型，在现实应用中构成严重威胁。现有防御方法如PatchCleanser需要两轮掩码且计算复杂度高，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出CertMask方法，使用数学严谨的覆盖策略构建二进制掩码集，确保每个可能的补丁位置至少被覆盖k次，仅需单轮掩码操作，时间复杂度为O(n)。

Result: 在ImageNet、ImageNette和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，CertMask相比PatchCleanser将认证鲁棒精度提升高达+13.4%，同时保持与原始模型几乎相同的清洁精度。

Conclusion: CertMask提供了一种高效且可证明鲁棒的防御机制，显著降低了对抗性补丁攻击的防御成本，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks inject localized perturbations into images to mislead deep vision models. These attacks can be physically deployed, posing serious risks to real-world applications. In this paper, we propose CertMask, a certifiably robust defense that constructs a provably sufficient set of binary masks to neutralize patch effects with strong theoretical guarantees. While the state-of-the-art approach (PatchCleanser) requires two rounds of masking and incurs $O(n^2)$ inference cost, CertMask performs only a single round of masking with $O(n)$ time complexity, where $n$ is the cardinality of the mask set to cover an input image. Our proposed mask set is computed using a mathematically rigorous coverage strategy that ensures each possible patch location is covered at least $k$ times, providing both efficiency and robustness. We offer a theoretical analysis of the coverage condition and prove its sufficiency for certification. Experiments on ImageNet, ImageNette, and CIFAR-10 show that CertMask improves certified robust accuracy by up to +13.4\% over PatchCleanser, while maintaining clean accuracy nearly identical to the vanilla model.

Abstract: Space weather at Earth, driven by the solar activity, poses growing risks to satellites around our planet as well as to critical ground-based technological infrastructure. Major space weather contributors are the solar wind and coronal mass ejections whose variable density, speed, temperature, and magnetic field make the automated classification of those structures challenging. In this work, we adapt a foundation model for solar physics, originally trained on Solar Dynamics Observatory imagery, to create embeddings suitable for solar wind structure analysis. These embeddings are concatenated with the spacecraft position and solar magnetic connectivity encoded using Fourier features which generates a neural field-based model. The full deep learning architecture is fine-tuned bridging the gap between remote sensing and in situ observations. Labels are derived from Parker Solar Probe measurements, forming a downstream classification task that maps plasma properties to solar wind structures. Although overall classification performance is modest, likely due to coarse labeling, class imbalance, and limited transferability of the pretrained model, this study demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging foundation model embeddings for in situ solar wind tasks. As a first proof-of-concept, it lays the groundwork for future improvements toward more reliable space weather predictions. The code and configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support reproducibility.

Conclusion: IPCD方法成功解决了点云分解的关键挑战，在真实世界应用中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used in various fields, including augmented reality (AR) and robotics, where relighting and texture editing are crucial for realistic visualization. Achieving these tasks requires accurately separating albedo from shade. However, performing this separation on point clouds presents two key challenges: (1) the non-grid structure of point clouds makes conventional image-based decomposition models ineffective, and (2) point-cloud models designed for other tasks do not explicitly consider global-light direction, resulting in inaccurate shade. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Intrinsic Point-Cloud Decomposition (IPCD)}, which extends image decomposition to the direct decomposition of colored point clouds into albedo and shade. To overcome challenge (1), we propose \textbf{IPCD-Net} that extends image-based model with point-wise feature aggregation for non-grid data processing. For challenge (2), we introduce \textbf{Projection-based Luminance Distribution (PLD)} with a hierarchical feature refinement, capturing global-light ques via multi-view projection. For comprehensive evaluation, we create a synthetic outdoor-scene dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that IPCD-Net reduces cast shadows in albedo and enhances color accuracy in shade. Furthermore, we showcase its applications in texture editing, relighting, and point-cloud registration under varying illumination. Finally, we verify the real-world applicability of IPCD-Net.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在使用旋转位置编码时面临远程依赖建模挑战，ROPE导致注意力随距离增加而衰减，影响全局上下文记忆能力。

Method: 提出推理阶段三步骤衰减恢复策略：语义驱动DRS增强远程语义信号，距离感知控制DRS平滑调节注意力权重，重新强化远程DRS巩固剩余远程依赖。

Result: 在视觉问答基准测试中，T-DRS方法能够一致性地提升模型性能，且无需额外训练。

Conclusion: T-DRS策略有效缓解了ROPE引起的注意力衰减问题，恢复了被抑制的远程token对，同时不损害局部归纳偏置，提升了模型的全局连贯性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks. However, they still face critical challenges in modeling long-range dependencies under the usage of Rotary Positional Encoding (ROPE). Although it can facilitate precise modeling of token positions, it induces progressive attention decay as token distance increases, especially with progressive attention decay over distant token pairs, which severely impairs the model's ability to remember global context. To alleviate this issue, we propose inference-only Three-step Decay Resilience Strategies (T-DRS), comprising (1) Semantic-Driven DRS (SD-DRS), amplifying semantically meaningful but distant signals via content-aware residuals, (2) Distance-aware Control DRS (DC-DRS), which can purify attention by smoothly modulating weights based on positional distances, suppressing noise while preserving locality, and (3) re-Reinforce Distant DRS (reRD-DRS), consolidating the remaining informative remote dependencies to maintain global coherence. Together, the T-DRS recover suppressed long-range token pairs without harming local inductive biases. Extensive experiments on Vision Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks demonstrate that T-DRS can consistently improve performance in a training-free manner.

Conclusion: SAM-DAQ通过深度和时序线索的无缝集成，成功将SAM2适配于视频显著目标检测，实现了优越性能。

Abstract: Recently segment anything model (SAM) has attracted widespread concerns, and it is often treated as a vision foundation model for universal segmentation. Some researchers have attempted to directly apply the foundation model to the RGB-D video salient object detection (RGB-D VSOD) task, which often encounters three challenges, including the dependence on manual prompts, the high memory consumption of sequential adapters, and the computational burden of memory attention. To address the limitations, we propose a novel method, namely Segment Anything Model with Depth-guided Adaptive Queries (SAM-DAQ), which adapts SAM2 to pop-out salient objects from videos by seamlessly integrating depth and temporal cues within a unified framework. Firstly, we deploy a parallel adapter-based multi-modal image encoder (PAMIE), which incorporates several depth-guided parallel adapters (DPAs) in a skip-connection way. Remarkably, we fine-tune the frozen SAM encoder under prompt-free conditions, where the DPA utilizes depth cues to facilitate the fusion of multi-modal features. Secondly, we deploy a query-driven temporal memory (QTM) module, which unifies the memory bank and prompt embeddings into a learnable pipeline. Concretely, by leveraging both frame-level queries and video-level queries simultaneously, the QTM module can not only selectively extract temporal consistency features but also iteratively update the temporal representations of the queries. Extensive experiments are conducted on three RGB-D VSOD datasets, and the results show that the proposed SAM-DAQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of all evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 当前3D-VLMs直接将3D点云嵌入为3D令牌，导致在大型语言模型部分处理所有3D令牌时产生巨大计算成本，限制了应用。

Method: 提出分层补偿压缩(HCC-3D)：1) 全局结构压缩(GSC)，使用全局查询将3D令牌压缩为少量关键令牌；2) 自适应细节挖掘(ADM)，通过互补评分选择性重新压缩显著但未被充分关注的特征。

Result: HCC-3D实现了约98%的极端压缩率，相比之前的3D-VLMs，同时达到了新的最先进性能，在效率和性能上都有显著提升。

Conclusion: HCC-3D方法有效解决了3D-VLMs的计算瓶颈问题，通过分层压缩策略在保持信息完整性的同时大幅降低计算开销。

Abstract: 3D understanding has drawn significant attention recently, leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable multi-modal reasoning between point cloud and text data. Current 3D-VLMs directly embed the 3D point clouds into 3D tokens, following large 2D-VLMs with powerful reasoning capabilities. However, this framework has a great computational cost limiting its application, where we identify that the bottleneck lies in processing all 3D tokens in the Large Language Model (LLM) part. This raises the question: how can we reduce the computational overhead introduced by 3D tokens while preserving the integrity of their essential information? To address this question, we introduce Hierarchical Compensatory Compression (HCC-3D) to efficiently compress 3D tokens while maintaining critical detail retention. Specifically, we first propose a global structure compression (GSC), in which we design global queries to compress all 3D tokens into a few key tokens while keeping overall structural information. Then, to compensate for the information loss in GSC, we further propose an adaptive detail mining (ADM) module that selectively recompresses salient but under-attended features through complementary scoring. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HCC-3D not only achieves extreme compression ratios (approximately 98%) compared to previous 3D-VLMs, but also achieves new state-of-the-art performance, showing the great improvements on both efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Automated medical image captioning translates complex radiological images into diagnostic narratives that can support reporting workflows. We present a Swin-BART encoder-decoder system with a lightweight regional attention module that amplifies diagnostically salient regions before cross-attention. Trained and evaluated on ROCO, our model achieves state-of-the-art semantic fidelity while remaining compact and interpretable. We report results as mean$\pm$std over three seeds and include $95\%$ confidence intervals. Compared with baselines, our approach improves ROUGE (proposed 0.603, ResNet-CNN 0.356, BLIP2-OPT 0.255) and BERTScore (proposed 0.807, BLIP2-OPT 0.645, ResNet-CNN 0.623), with competitive BLEU, CIDEr, and METEOR. We further provide ablations (regional attention on/off and token-count sweep), per-modality analysis (CT/MRI/X-ray), paired significance tests, and qualitative heatmaps that visualize the regions driving each description. Decoding uses beam search (beam size $=4$), length penalty $=1.1$, $no\_repeat\_ngram\_size$ $=3$, and max length $=128$. The proposed design yields accurate, clinically phrased captions and transparent regional attributions, supporting safe research use with a human in the loop.

Motivation: 现实场景中（如天气或光照变化）域偏移通常是连续渐变的，而现有的离散数据增强和静态扰动方法无法有效捕捉特征分布的动态变化，限制了模型感知细粒度跨域差异的能力。

Method: 引入可控高斯噪声注入和多尺度高斯模糊来模拟初始特征扰动，然后通过时间建模和液体参数调整机制生成自适应调制参数，实现跨域的平滑连续适应。

Conclusion: 通过捕捉渐进跨域特征演化和动态调节适应路径，该方法有效弥合了源域-未知域分布差距，显著提升了模型对未见域偏移的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection (Single-DGOD), aiming to transfer a detector trained on one source domain to multiple unknown domains. Existing methods for Single-DGOD typically rely on discrete data augmentation or static perturbation methods to expand data diversity, thereby mitigating the lack of access to target domain data. However, in real-world scenarios such as changes in weather or lighting conditions, domain shifts often occur continuously and gradually. Discrete augmentations and static perturbations fail to effectively capture the dynamic variation of feature distributions, thereby limiting the model's ability to perceive fine-grained cross-domain differences. To this end, we propose a new method, Liquid Temporal Feature Evolution, which simulates the progressive evolution of features from the source domain to simulated latent distributions by incorporating temporal modeling and liquid neural network-driven parameter adjustment. Specifically, we introduce controllable Gaussian noise injection and multi-scale Gaussian blurring to simulate initial feature perturbations, followed by temporal modeling and a liquid parameter adjustment mechanism to generate adaptive modulation parameters, enabling a smooth and continuous adaptation across domains. By capturing progressive cross-domain feature evolution and dynamically regulating adaptation paths, our method bridges the source-unknown domain distribution gap, significantly boosting generalization and robustness to unseen shifts. Significant performance improvements on the Diverse Weather dataset and Real-to-Art benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/2490o/LTFE.

Conclusion: MosaicDoc作为该领域的权威基准，为未来研究指明了清晰路径，强调了需要改进模型处理复杂文档布局的能力。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capabilities are inadequately assessed by existing benchmarks, which are predominantly English-centric, feature simplistic layouts, and support limited tasks. Consequently, they fail to evaluate model performance for Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU), a critical challenge involving complex layouts and dense text. To address this, we introduce DocWeaver, a novel multi-agent pipeline that leverages Large Language Models to automatically generate a new benchmark. The result is MosaicDoc, a large-scale, bilingual (Chinese and English) resource designed to push the boundaries of VRDU. Sourced from newspapers and magazines, MosaicDoc features diverse and complex layouts (including multi-column and non-Manhattan), rich stylistic variety from 196 publishers, and comprehensive multi-task annotations (OCR, VQA, reading order, and localization). With 72K images and over 600K QA pairs, MosaicDoc serves as a definitive benchmark for the field. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on this benchmark reveals their current limitations in handling real-world document complexity and charts a clear path for future research.

Conclusion: SLDC通过补偿分布漂移，有效解决了序列微调中的关键问题，使SeqFT在类增量学习中表现优异。

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that sequential fine-tuning (SeqFT) of pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs), followed by classifier refinement using approximate distributions of class features, can be an effective strategy for class-incremental learning (CIL). However, this approach is susceptible to distribution drift, caused by the sequential optimization of shared backbone parameters. This results in a mismatch between the distributions of the previously learned classes and that of the updater model, ultimately degrading the effectiveness of classifier performance over time. To address this issue, we introduce a latent space transition operator and propose Sequential Learning with Drift Compensation (SLDC). SLDC aims to align feature distributions across tasks to mitigate the impact of drift. First, we present a linear variant of SLDC, which learns a linear operator by solving a regularized least-squares problem that maps features before and after fine-tuning. Next, we extend this with a weakly nonlinear SLDC variant, which assumes that the ideal transition operator lies between purely linear and fully nonlinear transformations. This is implemented using learnable, weakly nonlinear mappings that balance flexibility and generalization. To further reduce representation drift, we apply knowledge distillation (KD) in both algorithmic variants. Extensive experiments on standard CIL benchmarks demonstrate that SLDC significantly improves the performance of SeqFT. Notably, by combining KD to address representation drift with SLDC to compensate distribution drift, SeqFT achieves performance comparable to joint training across all evaluated datasets.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) is a fundamental task in many real-world applications such as pedestrian trajectory tracking. However, advanced deep learning-based ReID models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations to pedestrian images can cause entirely incorrect predictions, posing significant security threats. Although numerous adversarial defense strategies have been proposed for classification tasks, their extension to metric learning tasks such as person ReID remains relatively unexplored. Moreover, the several existing defenses for person ReID fail to address the inherent unique challenges of adversarially robust ReID. In this paper, we systematically identify the challenges of adversarial defense in person ReID into two key issues: model bias and composite generalization requirements. To address them, we propose a debiased dual-invariant defense framework composed of two main phases. In the data balancing phase, we mitigate model bias using a diffusion-model-based data resampling strategy that promotes fairness and diversity in training data. In the bi-adversarial self-meta defense phase, we introduce a novel metric adversarial training approach incorporating farthest negative extension softening to overcome the robustness degradation caused by the absence of classifier. Additionally, we introduce an adversarially-enhanced self-meta mechanism to achieve dual-generalization for both unseen identities and unseen attack types. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art defenses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在速度-质量权衡方面表现良好，但假设每个像素单一深度的传统方法无法处理半透明表面，因为多个表面可能同时可见。

Method: 提出TSPE-GS方法，通过均匀采样透射率替代先前的单峰假设，解决跨表面深度模糊问题；通过逐步融合截断符号距离函数，在统一框架内分别重建外部和内部表面。

Result: 在公开和自收集的半透明及不透明数据集上的广泛实验表明，TSPE-GS显著改善了半透明几何重建，同时保持了对不透明场景的性能。

Conclusion: TSPE-GS能够泛化到其他基于高斯的重建流程，无需额外训练开销，有效解决了半透明表面重建的挑战。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting offers a strong speed-quality trade-off but struggles to reconstruct semi-transparent surfaces because most methods assume a single depth per pixel, which fails when multiple surfaces are visible. We propose TSPE-GS (Transparent Surface Probabilistic Extraction for Gaussian Splatting), which uniformly samples transmittance to model a pixel-wise multi-modal distribution of opacity and depth, replacing the prior single-peak assumption and resolving cross-surface depth ambiguity. By progressively fusing truncated signed distance functions, TSPE-GS reconstructs external and internal surfaces separately within a unified framework. The method generalizes to other Gaussian-based reconstruction pipelines without extra training overhead. Extensive experiments on public and self-collected semi-transparent and opaque datasets show TSPE-GS significantly improves semi-transparent geometry reconstruction while maintaining performance on opaque scenes.

Motivation: 现有方法仅使用CLIP的余弦相似度进行图像质量评估，忽略了图像特征幅度与感知质量之间的强相关性，需要一种更全面的质量评估方法。

Method: 提出自适应融合框架：提取CLIP图像特征的绝对值，应用Box-Cox变换进行统计归一化，生成语义归一化的辅助线索，并通过置信度引导的融合方案自适应加权整合余弦相似度和幅度线索。

Conclusion: CLIP图像特征的幅度是感知质量的重要线索，通过自适应融合余弦相似度和幅度线索，可以有效提升无参考图像质量评估的性能。

Abstract: Recent efforts have repurposed the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) by measuring the cosine similarity between the image embedding and textual prompts such as "a good photo" or "a bad photo." However, this semantic similarity overlooks a critical yet underexplored cue: the magnitude of the CLIP image features, which we empirically find to exhibit a strong correlation with perceptual quality. In this work, we introduce a novel adaptive fusion framework that complements cosine similarity with a magnitude-aware quality cue. Specifically, we first extract the absolute CLIP image features and apply a Box-Cox transformation to statistically normalize the feature distribution and mitigate semantic sensitivity. The resulting scalar summary serves as a semantically-normalized auxiliary cue that complements cosine-based prompt matching. To integrate both cues effectively, we further design a confidence-guided fusion scheme that adaptively weighs each term according to its relative strength. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark IQA datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms standard CLIP-based IQA and state-of-the-art baselines, without any task-specific training.

TL;DR: 提出一种利用视觉语言模型自动生成伪标签来训练高效实时目标检测器的新方法，采用基于每对象协同教学的训练策略来减轻VLM生成标签中的噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在零样本目标检测方面表现优异，但存在检测延迟和幻觉预测问题，无法直接部署。手动标注成本高昂，需要一种自动化的解决方案来训练高效的实时目标检测器。

Method: 提出基于每对象协同教学的训练策略，两个YOLO模型协作学习，根据彼此的对象级损失值过滤不可靠的边界框，而不是过滤整个图像。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，方法显著提升了基线YOLOv5m模型的性能，mAP@0.5从31.12%提升到46.61%，同时保持实时检测延迟。补充10%真实标签后，性能进一步提升至57.97% mAP@0.5。在ACDC和BDD100k数据集上也观察到类似的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该管道为自动驾驶提供了一种高效、鲁棒且可扩展的方法来训练高性能目标检测器，显著减少了对昂贵人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Foundation models, especially vision-language models (VLMs), offer compelling zero-shot object detection for applications like autonomous driving, a domain where manual labelling is prohibitively expensive. However, their detection latency and tendency to hallucinate predictions render them unsuitable for direct deployment. This work introduces a novel pipeline that addresses this challenge by leveraging VLMs to automatically generate pseudo-labels for training efficient, real-time object detectors. Our key innovation is a per-object co-teaching-based training strategy that mitigates the inherent noise in VLM-generated labels. The proposed per-object coteaching approach filters noisy bounding boxes from training instead of filtering the entire image. Specifically, two YOLO models learn collaboratively, filtering out unreliable boxes from each mini-batch based on their peers' per-object loss values. Overall, our pipeline provides an efficient, robust, and scalable approach to train high-performance object detectors for autonomous driving, significantly reducing reliance on costly human annotation. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms a baseline YOLOv5m model, achieving a significant mAP@0.5 boost ($31.12\%$ to $46.61\%$) while maintaining real-time detection latency. Furthermore, we show that supplementing our pseudo-labelled data with a small fraction of ground truth labels ($10\%$) leads to further performance gains, reaching $57.97\%$ mAP@0.5 on the KITTI dataset. We observe similar performance improvements for the ACDC and BDD100k datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models, especially diffusion models, have significantly improved image restoration (IR) performance. However, existing problem-agnostic diffusion model-based image restoration (DMIR) methods face challenges in fully leveraging diffusion priors, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we address the limitations of current problem-agnostic DMIR methods by analyzing their sampling process and providing effective solutions. We introduce EquS, a DMIR method that imposes equivariant information through dual sampling trajectories. To further boost EquS, we propose the Timestep-Aware Schedule (TAS) and introduce EquS$^+$. TAS prioritizes deterministic steps to enhance certainty and sampling efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method is compatible with previous problem-agnostic DMIR methods and significantly boosts their performance without increasing computational costs.

TL;DR: 本文提出DiVE方法，通过约束预训练和微调模型嵌入之间的差异向量来保持几何结构，从而在ID数据上稳健微调视觉语言模型而不损害OOD和零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于对比学习的微调方法会扭曲嵌入的几何结构，导致OOD和零样本性能受限。需要一种能保持几何结构的微调方法。

Method: 提出差异向量均衡化(DiVE)，通过平均向量损失(AVL)和成对向量损失(PVL)约束差异向量，分别从全局和局部保持几何结构。

Result: 实验表明DiVE能有效保持几何结构，在ID、OOD和零样本指标上均取得良好结果。

Conclusion: DiVE通过约束差异向量来保持几何结构，实现了在保持泛化能力的同时进行稳健微调。

Abstract: Contrastive pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, demonstrate strong generalization abilities in zero-shot classification by leveraging embeddings extracted from image and text encoders. This paper aims to robustly fine-tune these vision-language models on in-distribution (ID) data without compromising their generalization abilities in out-of-distribution (OOD) and zero-shot settings. Current robust fine-tuning methods tackle this challenge by reusing contrastive learning, which was used in pre-training, for fine-tuning. However, we found that these methods distort the geometric structure of the embeddings, which plays a crucial role in the generalization of vision-language models, resulting in limited OOD and zero-shot performance. To address this, we propose Difference Vector Equalization (DiVE), which preserves the geometric structure during fine-tuning. The idea behind DiVE is to constrain difference vectors, each of which is obtained by subtracting the embeddings extracted from the pre-trained and fine-tuning models for the same data sample. By constraining the difference vectors to be equal across various data samples, we effectively preserve the geometric structure. Therefore, we introduce two losses: average vector loss (AVL) and pairwise vector loss (PVL). AVL preserves the geometric structure globally by constraining difference vectors to be equal to their weighted average. PVL preserves the geometric structure locally by ensuring a consistent multimodal alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that DiVE effectively preserves the geometric structure, achieving strong results across ID, OOD, and zero-shot metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景文本编辑方法存在三个主要问题：缺乏对低资源语言的支持、合成数据与真实数据之间的领域差距、以及缺乏合适的文本样式保持评估指标。

Method: STELLAR采用语言自适应字形编码器，通过多阶段训练策略（先在合成数据上预训练，然后在真实图像上微调），并构建了新的数据集STIPLAR用于训练和评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，STELLAR在视觉一致性和识别准确率方面优于最先进模型，在TAS指标上平均比基线方法提高了2.2%。

Conclusion: STELLAR通过创新的架构设计和训练策略，有效解决了场景文本编辑中的关键挑战，特别是在低资源语言和真实世界数据场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Scene Text Editing (STE) is the task of modifying text content in an image while preserving its visual style, such as font, color, and background. While recent diffusion-based approaches have shown improvements in visual quality, key limitations remain: lack of support for low-resource languages, domain gap between synthetic and real data, and the absence of appropriate metrics for evaluating text style preservation. To address these challenges, we propose STELLAR (Scene Text Editor for Low-resource LAnguages and Real-world data). STELLAR enables reliable multilingual editing through a language-adaptive glyph encoder and a multi-stage training strategy that first pre-trains on synthetic data and then fine-tunes on real images. We also construct a new dataset, STIPLAR(Scene Text Image Pairs of Low-resource lAnguages and Real-world data), for training and evaluation. Furthermore, we propose Text Appearance Similarity (TAS), a novel metric that assesses style preservation by independently measuring font, color, and background similarity, enabling robust evaluation even without ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate that STELLAR outperforms state-of-the-art models in visual consistency and recognition accuracy, achieving an average TAS improvement of 2.2% across languages over the baselines.

Conclusion: MOBA揭示了一类新的物理可实现威胁，并强调了在真实环境中考虑材料级属性的防御措施的迫切需要。

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detection is widely used in safety-critical systems. However, these systems remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that embed hidden malicious behaviors during training. A key limitation of existing backdoor attacks is their lack of physical realizability, primarily due to the digital-to-physical domain gap. Digital triggers often fail in real-world settings because they overlook material-dependent LiDAR reflection properties. On the other hand, physically constructed triggers are often unoptimized, leading to low effectiveness or easy detectability.This paper introduces Material-Oriented Backdoor Attack (MOBA), a novel framework that bridges the digital-physical gap by explicitly modeling the material properties of real-world triggers. MOBA tackles two key challenges in physical backdoor design: 1) robustness of the trigger material under diverse environmental conditions, 2) alignment between the physical trigger's behavior and its digital simulation. First, we propose a systematic approach to selecting robust trigger materials, identifying titanium dioxide (TiO_2) for its high diffuse reflectivity and environmental resilience. Second, to ensure the digital trigger accurately mimics the physical behavior of the material-based trigger, we develop a novel simulation pipeline that features: (1) an angle-independent approximation of the Oren-Nayar BRDF model to generate realistic LiDAR intensities, and (2) a distance-aware scaling mechanism to maintain spatial consistency across varying depths. We conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LiDAR-based and Camera-LiDAR fusion models, showing that MOBA achieves a 93.50% attack success rate, outperforming prior methods by over 41%. Our work reveals a new class of physically realizable threats and underscores the urgent need for defenses that account for material-level properties in real-world environments.

Conclusion: LampQ通过克服现有混合精度量化方法的局限性，为Vision Transformers提供了准确且高效的量化解决方案。

Abstract: How can we accurately quantize a pre-trained Vision Transformer model? Quantization algorithms compress Vision Transformers (ViTs) into low-bit formats, reducing memory and computation demands with minimal accuracy degradation. However, existing methods rely on uniform precision, ignoring the diverse sensitivity of ViT components to quantization. Metric-based Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) is a promising alternative, but previous MPQ methods for ViTs suffer from three major limitations: 1) coarse granularity, 2) mismatch in metric scale across component types, and 3) quantization-unaware bit allocation. In this paper, we propose LampQ (Layer-wise Mixed Precision Quantization for Vision Transformers), an accurate metric-based MPQ method for ViTs to overcome these limitations. LampQ performs layer-wise quantization to achieve both fine-grained control and efficient acceleration, incorporating a type-aware Fisher-based metric to measure sensitivity. Then, LampQ assigns bit-widths optimally through integer linear programming and further updates them iteratively. Extensive experiments show that LampQ provides the state-of-the-art performance in quantizing ViTs pre-trained on various tasks such as image classification, object detection, and zero-shot quantization.

Abstract: Effective human-agent collaboration in physical environments requires understanding not only what to act upon, but also where the actionable elements are and how to interact with them. Existing approaches often operate at the object level or disjointedly handle fine-grained affordance reasoning, lacking coherent, instruction-driven grounding and reasoning. In this work, we introduce a new task: Fine-grained 3D Embodied Reasoning, which requires an agent to predict, for each referenced affordance element in a 3D scene, a structured triplet comprising its spatial location, motion type, and motion axis, based on a task instruction. To solve this task, we propose AffordBot, a novel framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with a tailored chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paradigm. To bridge the gap between 3D input and 2D-compatible MLLMs, we render surround-view images of the scene and project 3D element candidates into these views, forming a rich visual representation aligned with the scene geometry. Our CoT pipeline begins with an active perception stage, prompting the MLLM to select the most informative viewpoint based on the instruction, before proceeding with step-by-step reasoning to localize affordance elements and infer plausible interaction motions. Evaluated on the SceneFun3D dataset, AffordBot achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating strong generalization and physically grounded reasoning with only 3D point cloud input and MLLMs.

Abstract: We propose Anomagic, a zero-shot anomaly generation method that produces semantically coherent anomalies without requiring any exemplar anomalies. By unifying both visual and textual cues through a crossmodal prompt encoding scheme, Anomagic leverages rich contextual information to steer an inpainting-based generation pipeline. A subsequent contrastive refinement strategy enforces precise alignment between synthesized anomalies and their masks, thereby bolstering downstream anomaly detection accuracy. To facilitate training, we introduce AnomVerse, a collection of 12,987 anomaly-mask-caption triplets assembled from 13 publicly available datasets, where captions are automatically generated by multimodal large language models using structured visual prompts and template-based textual hints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomagic trained on AnomVerse can synthesize more realistic and varied anomalies than prior methods, yielding superior improvements in downstream anomaly detection. Furthermore, Anomagic can generate anomalies for any normal-category image using user-defined prompts, establishing a versatile foundation model for anomaly generation.

Abstract: As a critical task in autonomous driving perception systems, 3D object detection is used to identify and track key objects, such as vehicles and pedestrians. However, detecting distant, small, or occluded objects (hard instances) remains a challenge, which directly compromises the safety of autonomous driving systems. We observe that existing multi-modal 3D object detection methods often follow a single-guided paradigm, failing to account for the differences in information density of hard instances between modalities. In this work, we propose DGFusion, based on the Dual-guided paradigm, which fully inherits the advantages of the Point-guide-Image paradigm and integrates the Image-guide-Point paradigm to address the limitations of the single paradigms. The core of DGFusion, the Difficulty-aware Instance Pair Matcher (DIPM), performs instance-level feature matching based on difficulty to generate easy and hard instance pairs, while the Dual-guided Modules exploit the advantages of both pair types to enable effective multi-modal feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFusion outperforms the baseline methods, with respective improvements of +1.0\% mAP, +0.8\% NDS, and +1.3\% average recall on nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent robustness gains for hard instance detection across ego-distance, size, visibility, and small-scale training scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法克服了现有3D表示方法的局限性，为处理复杂拓扑结构提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D contents remains a fundamental challenge due to the complexity of representing arbitrary topologies-such as open surfaces and intricate internal structures-while preserving geometric details. Prevailing methods based on signed distance fields (SDFs) are hampered by costly watertight preprocessing and struggle with non-manifold geometries, while point-cloud representations often suffer from sampling artifacts and surface discontinuities. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) framework built upon unsigned distance fields (UDFs)-a more robust and computationally efficient representation that naturally handles complex and incomplete shapes. Our core innovation is a local-to-global (LoG) architecture that processes the UDF by partitioning it into uniform subvolumes, termed UBlocks. This architecture couples 3D convolutions for capturing local detail with sparse transformers for enforcing global coherence. A Pad-Average strategy further ensures smooth transitions at subvolume boundaries during reconstruction. This modular design enables seamless scaling to ultra-high resolutions up to 2048^3-a regime previously unattainable for 3D VAEs. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction accuracy and generative quality, yielding superior surface smoothness and geometric flexibility.

Abstract: Visible-infrared object detection has gained sufficient attention due to its detection performance in low light, fog, and rain conditions. However, visible and infrared modalities captured by different sensors exist the information imbalance problem in complex scenarios, which can cause inadequate cross-modal fusion, resulting in degraded detection performance. \textcolor{red}{Furthermore, most existing methods use transformers in the spatial domain to capture complementary features, ignoring the advantages of developing frequency domain transformers to mine complementary information.} To solve these weaknesses, we propose a frequency domain fusion transformer, called FreDFT, for visible-infrared object detection. The proposed approach employs a novel multimodal frequency domain attention (MFDA) to mine complementary information between modalities and a frequency domain feed-forward layer (FDFFL) via a mixed-scale frequency feature fusion strategy is designed to better enhance multimodal features. To eliminate the imbalance of multimodal information, a cross-modal global modeling module (CGMM) is constructed to perform pixel-wise inter-modal feature interaction in a spatial and channel manner. Moreover, a local feature enhancement module (LFEM) is developed to strengthen multimodal local feature representation and promote multimodal feature fusion by using various convolution layers and applying a channel shuffle. Extensive experimental results have verified that our proposed FreDFT achieves excellent performance on multiple public datasets compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The performance of image generation has been significantly improved in recent years. However, the study of image screening is rare and its performance with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is unsatisfactory due to the lack of data and the weak image aesthetic reasoning ability in MLLMs. In this work, we propose a complete solution to address these problems in terms of data and methodology. For data, we collect a comprehensive image screening dataset with over 128k samples, about 640k images. Each sample consists of an original image, four generated images. The dataset evaluates the image aesthetic reasoning ability under four aspects: appearance deformation, physical shadow, placement layout, and extension rationality. Regarding data annotation, we investigate multiple approaches, including purely manual, fully automated, and answer-driven annotations, to acquire high-quality chains of thought (CoT) data in the most cost-effective manner. Methodologically, we introduce a Hard Cases Mining (HCM) strategy with a Dynamic Proportional Accuracy (DPA) reward into the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, called HCM-GRPO. This enhanced method demonstrates superior image aesthetic reasoning capabilities compared to the original GRPO. Our experimental results reveal that even state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs, such as GPT4o and Qwen-VL-Max, exhibit performance akin to random guessing in image aesthetic reasoning. In contrast, by leveraging the HCM-GRPO, we are able to surpass the scores of both large-scale open-source and leading closed-source models with a much smaller model.

To study this, we introduce a new benchmark, AV-ConfuseBench, which simulates an ``Audio-Visual Confusion'' scene by modifying the corresponding sound of an object in the video, e.g., mute the sounding object and ask MLLMs Is there a/an muted-object sound''. Experimental results reveal that MLLMs, such as Qwen2.5-Omni and Gemini 2.5, struggle to discriminate non-existent audio due to visually dominated reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we introduce RL-CoMM, a Reinforcement Learning-based Collaborative Multi-MLLM that is built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni foundation. RL-CoMM includes two stages: 1) To alleviate visually dominated ambiguities, we introduce an external model, a Large Audio Language Model (LALM), as the reference model to generate audio-only reasoning. Then, we design a Step-wise Reasoning Reward function that enables MLLMs to self-improve audio-visual reasoning with the audio-only reference. 2) To ensure an accurate answer prediction, we introduce Answer-centered Confidence Optimization to reduce the uncertainty of potential heterogeneous reasoning differences. Extensive experiments on audio-visual question answering and audio-visual hallucination show that RL-CoMM improves the accuracy by 10~30\% over the baseline model with limited training data.

Motivation: 医疗视觉中的细粒度动作评估面临数据集不足、精度要求严格、快速动作时空动态建模不充分等挑战。

Method: 提出多元高斯表示法，将关节运动投影到时标多维空间，分解为自适应3D高斯作为token；采用笛卡尔和向量双流策略的混合空间编码有效利用骨骼信息。

Result: 在CPREval-6k数据集上达到92.1% Top-1准确率，比ST-GCN基线提升5.9%，仅需10% FLOPs；跨数据集实验验证了方法的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GaussMedAct框架通过自适应时空表示学习显著提升了医疗动作分析的性能，在精度和效率方面均表现出色。

Abstract: Fine-grained action evaluation in medical vision faces unique challenges due to the unavailability of comprehensive datasets, stringent precision requirements, and insufficient spatiotemporal dynamic modeling of very rapid actions. To support development and evaluation, we introduce CPREval-6k, a multi-view, multi-label medical action benchmark containing 6,372 expert-annotated videos with 22 clinical labels. Using this dataset, we present GaussMedAct, a multivariate Gaussian encoding framework, to advance medical motion analysis through adaptive spatiotemporal representation learning. Multivariate Gaussian Representation projects the joint motions to a temporally scaled multi-dimensional space, and decomposes actions into adaptive 3D Gaussians that serve as tokens. These tokens preserve motion semantics through anisotropic covariance modeling while maintaining robustness to spatiotemporal noise. Hybrid Spatial Encoding, employing a Cartesian and Vector dual-stream strategy, effectively utilizes skeletal information in the form of joint and bone features. The proposed method achieves 92.1% Top-1 accuracy with real-time inference on the benchmark, outperforming the ST-GCN baseline by +5.9% accuracy with only 10% FLOPs. Cross-dataset experiments confirm the superiority of our method in robustness.

TL;DR: CABIN是一个半监督学习框架，通过感知-行动-修正的闭环过程解决高光谱图像分类中置信度误导的问题，利用不确定性估计和动态分配策略提升模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分类中，模型往往将高预测分数误认为正确性，缺乏不确定性意识，导致在稀疏标注或类别不平衡情况下产生确认偏差和过拟合问题。

Method: CABIN采用认知感知的行为驱动学习：1）感知阶段估计认知不确定性识别模糊区域；2）行动阶段使用不确定性引导的双重采样策略；3）修正阶段引入细粒度动态分配策略对伪标签数据进行分类处理。

Result: 实验结果表明，多种最先进方法在集成CABIN后都获得了改进，提高了标注效率和性能表现。

Conclusion: CABIN框架通过不确定性感知和行为驱动的学习过程，有效解决了高光谱图像分类中的置信度误导问题，提升了模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Confidence alone is often misleading in hyperspectral image classification, as models tend to mistake high predictive scores for correctness while lacking awareness of uncertainty. This leads to confirmation bias, especially under sparse annotations or class imbalance, where models overfit confident errors and fail to generalize. We propose CABIN (Cognitive-Aware Behavior-Informed learNing), a semi-supervised framework that addresses this limitation through a closed-loop learning process of perception, action, and correction. CABIN first develops perceptual awareness by estimating epistemic uncertainty, identifying ambiguous regions where errors are likely to occur. It then acts by adopting an Uncertainty-Guided Dual Sampling Strategy, selecting uncertain samples for exploration while anchoring confident ones as stable pseudo-labels to reduce bias. To correct noisy supervision, CABIN introduces a Fine-Grained Dynamic Assignment Strategy that categorizes pseudo-labeled data into reliable, ambiguous, and noisy subsets, applying tailored losses to enhance generalization. Experimental results show that a wide range of state-of-the-art methods benefit from the integration of CABIN, with improved labeling efficiency and performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLF-MSC是一种统一的多模态语义通信系统，通过传输单一的视觉-语言特征来同时支持图像和文本生成，提高了频谱效率和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语义通信技术通常单独处理每种模态，需要特定的模态流或重传，导致频谱效率低下。VLF-MSC旨在通过统一的视觉-语言表示来解决这一问题。

Method: 使用预训练的视觉-语言模型将源图像编码为视觉-语言语义特征，通过无线信道传输。接收端基于该特征使用解码器语言模型和扩散图像生成器分别生成描述性文本和语义对齐的图像。

Result: 实验表明VLF-MSC在低信噪比下优于仅文本和仅图像的基线方法，为两种模态实现了更高的语义准确性，同时显著减少了带宽需求。

Conclusion: VLF-MSC通过统一的视觉-语言特征表示，实现了高效的多模态语义通信，在保持语义保真度的同时提高了频谱效率和对信道噪声的鲁棒性。

Abstract: We propose Vision-Language Feature-based Multimodal Semantic Communication (VLF-MSC), a unified system that transmits a single compact vision-language representation to support both image and text generation at the receiver. Unlike existing semantic communication techniques that process each modality separately, VLF-MSC employs a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to encode the source image into a vision-language semantic feature (VLF), which is transmitted over the wireless channel. At the receiver, a decoder-based language model and a diffusion-based image generator are both conditioned on the VLF to produce a descriptive text and a semantically aligned image. This unified representation eliminates the need for modality-specific streams or retransmissions, improving spectral efficiency and adaptability. By leveraging foundation models, the system achieves robustness to channel noise while preserving semantic fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that VLF-MSC outperforms text-only and image-only baselines, achieving higher semantic accuracy for both modalities under low SNR with significantly reduced bandwidth.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成方法通常在局部关节旋转上操作，这会导致层次误差累积，表现为末端效应器的不稳定和不合理运动。

Method: 提出GlobalDiff框架，在全局关节旋转空间操作；引入多级约束方案：关节结构约束、骨架结构约束和时间结构约束。

Result: 在标准共语音基准测试上的广泛评估显示，GlobalDiff生成平滑准确的运动，在多个说话者身份下比当前SOTA性能提升46.0%。

Conclusion: GlobalDiff通过全局旋转空间操作和多级约束，有效解决了层次误差累积问题，显著提升了共语音运动生成的质量和稳定性。

Abstract: Reliable co-speech motion generation requires precise motion representation and consistent structural priors across all joints. Existing generative methods typically operate on local joint rotations, which are defined hierarchically based on the skeleton structure. This leads to cumulative errors during generation, manifesting as unstable and implausible motions at end-effectors. In this work, we propose GlobalDiff, a diffusion-based framework that operates directly in the space of global joint rotations for the first time, fundamentally decoupling each joint's prediction from upstream dependencies and alleviating hierarchical error accumulation. To compensate for the absence of structural priors in global rotation space, we introduce a multi-level constraint scheme. Specifically, a joint structure constraint introduces virtual anchor points around each joint to better capture fine-grained orientation. A skeleton structure constraint enforces angular consistency across bones to maintain structural integrity. A temporal structure constraint utilizes a multi-scale variational encoder to align the generated motion with ground-truth temporal patterns. These constraints jointly regularize the global diffusion process and reinforce structural awareness. Extensive evaluations on standard co-speech benchmarks show that GlobalDiff generates smooth and accurate motions, improving the performance by 46.0 % compared to the current SOTA under multiple speaker identities.

*Yuxiang Duan,Ao Li,Yingqin Li,Luyu Li,Pengwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GridPrune是一种新的视觉token剪枝方法，采用"全局指导、局部选择"的两阶段策略来提升多模态大语言模型的效率，在保持96.98%性能的同时仅使用11.1%的token。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉token剪枝方法主要关注"选择什么"，而忽略了"看哪里"的问题，导致空间分配效率低下、位置偏差和保留无关token。受人类视觉系统启发，需要先确定关注区域再进行细粒度选择。

Method: GridPrune将剪枝过程分为两步：首先使用文本条件指导动态分配token预算到空间区域，然后在每个预算区域内进行局部选择，替代全局Top-K机制。

Result: 在LLaVA-NeXT-7B上，GridPrune在相同剪枝率下比最佳基线性能提升2.34%，仅使用11.1%的token就能保持96.98%的完整性能。

Conclusion: GridPrune通过模拟人类视觉系统的两阶段策略，有效解决了现有剪枝方法在空间分配效率方面的问题，在各种MLLM架构上都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens introduces significant computational overhead. To address this issue, visual token pruning has emerged as a key technique for enhancing the efficiency of MLLMs. In cognitive science, humans tend to first determine which regions of a scene to attend to ("where to look") before deciding which specific elements within those regions to process in detail ("what to select"). This two-stage strategy enables the visual system to efficiently allocate attention at a coarse spatial level before performing fine-grained selection. However, existing pruning methods primarily focus on directly optimizing "what to select", typically using attention scores or similarity metrics. They rarely consider "where to look", which has been shown to lead to inefficient spatial allocation, positional bias, and the retention of irrelevant or redundant tokens. In this paper, we propose GridPrune, a method that replaces the global Top-K mechanism with a "guide-globally, select-locally" zonal selection system. GridPrune splits the pruning process into two steps: first, it uses text-conditional guidance to dynamically allocate a token budget across spatial zones; and then, it performs local selection within each budgeted zone. Experimental results demonstrate that GridPrune achieves superior performance across various MLLM architectures. On LLaVA-NeXT-7B, GridPrune retains 96.98% of the full performance while using 11.1% of the tokens, outperforming the best-performing baseline by 2.34% at the same pruning rate.

Motivation: 探索LLMs与人体骨架结合进行动作识别，解决LLMs如何理解骨架数据和区分不同动作的问题。

Result: 在多个骨架动作分类基准测试中表现有效，零样本场景下比线性方法更具通用性。

Conclusion: SUGAR框架成功结合LLMs与骨架数据，提供了一种有效的动作识别和描述方法，在零样本场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold rich implicit knowledge and powerful transferability. In this paper, we explore the combination of LLMs with the human skeleton to perform action classification and description. However, when treating LLM as a recognizer, two questions arise: 1) How can LLMs understand skeleton? 2) How can LLMs distinguish among actions? To address these problems, we introduce a novel paradigm named learning Skeleton representation with visUal-motion knowledGe for Action Recognition (SUGAR). In our pipeline, we first utilize off-the-shelf large-scale video models as a knowledge base to generate visual, motion information related to actions. Then, we propose to supervise skeleton learning through this prior knowledge to yield discrete representations. Finally, we use the LLM with untouched pre-training weights to understand these representations and generate the desired action targets and descriptions. Notably, we present a Temporal Query Projection (TQP) module to continuously model the skeleton signals with long sequences. Experiments on several skeleton-based action classification benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our SUGAR. Moreover, experiments on zero-shot scenarios show that SUGAR is more versatile than linear-based methods.

Motivation: 解决真实环境中立体深度估计面临的动态域偏移、稀疏监督和高成本标注问题，现有测试时适应方法在持续变化场景下效果有限。

Result: 在动态目标域上实现了优越的适应性能，同时保持了计算效率。

Conclusion: RobIA框架在持续测试时适应中表现出色，能够有效应对域偏移问题，为立体深度估计提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Stereo Depth Estimation in real-world environments poses significant challenges due to dynamic domain shifts, sparse or unreliable supervision, and the high cost of acquiring dense ground-truth labels. While recent Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods offer promising solutions, most rely on static target domain assumptions and input-invariant adaptation strategies, limiting their effectiveness under continual shifts. In this paper, we propose RobIA, a novel Robust, Instance-Aware framework for Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) in stereo depth estimation. RobIA integrates two key components: (1) Attend-and-Excite Mixture-of-Experts (AttEx-MoE), a parameter-efficient module that dynamically routes input to frozen experts via lightweight self-attention mechanism tailored to epipolar geometry, and (2) Robust AdaptBN Teacher, a PEFT-based teacher model that provides dense pseudo-supervision by complementing sparse handcrafted labels. This strategy enables input-specific flexibility, broad supervision coverage, improving generalization under domain shift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RobIA achieves superior adaptation performance across dynamic target domains while maintaining computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖帧级或碎片化视频特征的隐式建模，无法捕捉事件序列的时间连贯性和视觉上下文的全面语义。

Method: CACMI框架包含两个核心组件：跨模态帧聚合通过跨模态检索提取时间连贯的事件对齐文本特征；上下文感知特征增强利用查询引导注意力整合视觉动态与伪事件语义。

Result: 在ActivityNet Captions和YouCook2数据集上的广泛实验表明，CACMI在密集视频描述任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CACMI通过显式的时间-语义建模，有效提升了密集视频描述的性能，证明了利用潜在时间特性和语言语义的重要性。

Abstract: Dense video captioning jointly localizes and captions salient events in untrimmed videos. Recent methods primarily focus on leveraging additional prior knowledge and advanced multi-task architectures to achieve competitive performance. However, these pipelines rely on implicit modeling that uses frame-level or fragmented video features, failing to capture the temporal coherence across event sequences and comprehensive semantics within visual contexts. To address this, we propose an explicit temporal-semantic modeling framework called Context-Aware Cross-Modal Interaction (CACMI), which leverages both latent temporal characteristics within videos and linguistic semantics from text corpus. Specifically, our model consists of two core components: Cross-modal Frame Aggregation aggregates relevant frames to extract temporally coherent, event-aligned textual features through cross-modal retrieval; and Context-aware Feature Enhancement utilizes query-guided attention to integrate visual dynamics with pseudo-event semantics. Extensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2 datasets demonstrate that CACMI achieves the state-of-the-art performance on dense video captioning task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查当今文本到图像模型在逻辑组合能力上的根本缺陷，特别关注否定、计数和空间关系这三个核心原语的组合使用问题。

Method: 通过分析训练数据、注意力架构和评估指标三个关键因素来追溯失败原因，并评估当前解决方案和简单扩展方法的效果。

Result: 发现训练数据中几乎完全没有明确的否定表达；连续注意力架构本质上不适合离散逻辑；评估指标奖励视觉合理性而非约束满足。当前解决方案无法弥合这一差距。

Conclusion: 实现真正的组合性需要表示和推理方面的根本性进步，而不是对现有架构的渐进式调整。

Abstract: The architectural blueprint of today's leading text-to-image models contains a fundamental flaw: an inability to handle logical composition. This survey investigates this breakdown across three core primitives-negation, counting, and spatial relations. Our analysis reveals a dramatic performance collapse: models that are accurate on single primitives fail precipitously when these are combined, exposing severe interference. We trace this failure to three key factors. First, training data show a near-total absence of explicit negations. Second, continuous attention architectures are fundamentally unsuitable for discrete logic. Third, evaluation metrics reward visual plausibility over constraint satisfaction. By analyzing recent benchmarks and methods, we show that current solutions and simple scaling cannot bridge this gap. Achieving genuine compositionality, we conclude, will require fundamental advances in representation and reasoning rather than incremental adjustments to existing architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多层感知机(MLP)架构中的低维特征空间限制了INR的表征能力。虽然增加MLP宽度可以线性提升特征空间维度，但会导致计算和内存成本的二次增长。

Method: 提出split-layer方法，将MLP的每一层划分为多个并行分支，通过Hadamard乘积整合分支输出，构建高次多项式空间来扩展特征空间维度。

Result: 大量实验表明，split-layer显著提升了INR性能，在2D图像拟合、2D CT重建、3D形状表示和5D新视角合成等多个任务中超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: split-layer通过有效扩展特征空间维度而不产生过高计算开销，成功增强了INR的表征能力，为各种逆问题提供了更高效的优化方案。

Abstract: Implicit neural representation (INR) models signals as continuous functions using neural networks, offering efficient and differentiable optimization for inverse problems across diverse disciplines. However, the representational capacity of INR defined by the range of functions the neural network can characterize, is inherently limited by the low-dimensional feature space in conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures. While widening the MLP can linearly increase feature space dimensionality, it also leads to a quadratic growth in computational and memory costs. To address this limitation, we propose the split-layer, a novel reformulation of MLP construction. The split-layer divides each layer into multiple parallel branches and integrates their outputs via Hadamard product, effectively constructing a high-degree polynomial space. This approach significantly enhances INR's representational capacity by expanding the feature space dimensionality without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the split-layer substantially improves INR performance, surpassing existing methods across multiple tasks, including 2D image fitting, 2D CT reconstruction, 3D shape representation, and 5D novel view synthesis.

Method: 采用双机制协同优化：在模型架构层面解耦对人口统计群体敏感的通道，在特征层面通过全局分布对齐减少总体样本分布与各群体分布之间的距离。

Result: 实验结果表明，相比其他方法，该框架在保持跨域检测精度的同时，显著提升了组间和组内公平性。

Conclusion: 提出的双机制协同优化框架有效解决了深度伪造检测中公平性与精度之间的权衡问题，为实现可信赖的检测模型部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Fairness is a core element in the trustworthy deployment of deepfake detection models, especially in the field of digital identity security. Biases in detection models toward different demographic groups, such as gender and race, may lead to systemic misjudgments, exacerbating the digital divide and social inequities. However, current fairness-enhanced detectors often improve fairness at the cost of detection accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a dual-mechanism collaborative optimization framework. Our proposed method innovatively integrates structural fairness decoupling and global distribution alignment: decoupling channels sensitive to demographic groups at the model architectural level, and subsequently reducing the distance between the overall sample distribution and the distributions corresponding to each demographic group at the feature level. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with other methods, our framework improves both inter-group and intra-group fairness while maintaining overall detection accuracy across domains.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像人物检索方法存在文本查询无法准确反映图像内容、跨模态对齐困难以及过度拟合有限数据集的问题，文本和图像之间的固有模态差距进一步加剧了这些挑战。

Method: GEA包含两个并行模块：文本引导的令牌增强（TGTE）使用扩散生成图像作为中间语义表示来弥合文本和视觉模式之间的差距；生成中间融合（GIF）结合生成图像、原始图像和文本特征的交叉注意力，生成通过三元组对齐损失优化的统一表示。

Result: 在CUHK-PEDES、RSTPReid和ICFG-PEDES三个公开数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: GEA方法通过生成增强的对齐策略有效解决了文本到图像人物检索中的模态差距问题，提高了检索性能。

Abstract: Text-to-Image Person Retrieval (TIPR) aims to retrieve person images based on natural language descriptions. Although many TIPR methods have achieved promising results, sometimes textual queries cannot accurately and comprehensively reflect the content of the image, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and overfitting to limited datasets. Moreover, the inherent modality gap between text and image further amplifies these issues, making accurate cross-modal retrieval even more challenging. To address these limitations, we propose the Generation-Enhanced Alignment (GEA) from a generative perspective. GEA contains two parallel modules: (1) Text-Guided Token Enhancement (TGTE), which introduces diffusion-generated images as intermediate semantic representations to bridge the gap between text and visual patterns. These generated images enrich the semantic representation of text and facilitate cross-modal alignment. (2) Generative Intermediate Fusion (GIF), which combines cross-attention between generated images, original images, and text features to generate a unified representation optimized by triplet alignment loss. We conduct extensive experiments on three public TIPR datasets, CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReid, and ICFG-PEDES, to evaluate the performance of GEA. The results justify the effectiveness of our method.

Our experiments show that even with as few as 5 training images, the models achieve high performance (F1 of 0.94, IoU of 0.79). Our results demonstrate the strong transfer learning capability of Prithvi, underscoring the potential of such models to support coastal monitoring in data-poor regions.

Conclusion: VISTA能够生成符合社会规范、目标感知且可解释的轨迹，在安全关键自主系统中具有应用前景。

Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous systems operating in dense, interactive environments. Existing methods often fail to jointly capture agents' long-term goals and their fine-grained social interactions, which leads to unrealistic multi-agent futures. We propose VISTA, a recursive goal-conditioned transformer for multi-agent trajectory forecasting. VISTA combines (i) a cross-attention fusion module that integrates long-horizon intent with past motion, (ii) a social-token attention mechanism for flexible interaction modeling across agents, and (iii) pairwise attention maps that make social influence patterns interpretable at inference time. Our model turns single-agent goal-conditioned prediction into a coherent multi-agent forecasting framework. Beyond standard displacement metrics, we evaluate trajectory collision rates as a measure of joint realism. On the high-density MADRAS benchmark and on SDD, VISTA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and substantially fewer collisions. On MADRAS, it reduces the average collision rate of strong baselines from 2.14 to 0.03 percent, and on SDD it attains zero collisions while improving ADE, FDE, and minFDE. These results show that VISTA generates socially compliant, goal-aware, and interpretable trajectories, making it promising for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Abstract: Recent multimodal deepfake detection methods designed for generalization conjecture that single-stage supervised training struggles to generalize across unseen manipulations and datasets. However, such approaches that target generalization require pretraining over real samples. Additionally, these methods primarily focus on detecting audio-visual inconsistencies and may overlook intra-modal artifacts causing them to fail against manipulations that preserve audio-visual alignment. To address these limitations, we propose a single-stage training framework that enhances generalization by incorporating next-frame prediction for both uni-modal and cross-modal features. Additionally, we introduce a window-level attention mechanism to capture discrepancies between predicted and actual frames, enabling the model to detect local artifacts around every frame, which is crucial for accurately classifying fully manipulated videos and effectively localizing deepfake segments in partially spoofed samples. Our model, evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrates strong generalization and precise temporal localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的弱监督STVG方法通常采用简单的后期融合方式，生成与文本描述无关的管状结构，导致目标识别失败和跟踪不一致。

Method: 提出Tube-conditioned Reconstruction with Mutual Constraints框架，使用预训练视觉定位模型生成文本条件候选管，并通过管状条件重建和时空约束进行细化，设计了时间、空间和时空三个重建策略。

Conclusion: TubeRMC框架通过管状条件重建和相互约束，显著提升了弱监督时空视频定位的性能。

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) aims to localize a spatio-temporal tube that corresponds to a given language query in an untrimmed video. This is a challenging task since it involves complex vision-language understanding and spatiotemporal reasoning. Recent works have explored weakly-supervised setting in STVG to eliminate reliance on fine-grained annotations like bounding boxes or temporal stamps. However, they typically follow a simple late-fusion manner, which generates tubes independent of the text description, often resulting in failed target identification and inconsistent target tracking. To address this limitation, we propose a Tube-conditioned Reconstruction with Mutual Constraints (\textbf{TubeRMC}) framework that generates text-conditioned candidate tubes with pre-trained visual grounding models and further refine them via tube-conditioned reconstruction with spatio-temporal constraints. Specifically, we design three reconstruction strategies from temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal perspectives to comprehensively capture rich tube-text correspondences. Each strategy is equipped with a Tube-conditioned Reconstructor, utilizing spatio-temporal tubes as condition to reconstruct the key clues in the query. We further introduce mutual constraints between spatial and temporal proposals to enhance their quality for reconstruction. TubeRMC outperforms existing methods on two public benchmarks VidSTG and HCSTVG. Further visualization shows that TubeRMC effectively mitigates both target identification errors and inconsistent tracking.

Conclusion: JudgeMind方法通过模拟裁判评分思维，显著提升了AQA的性能和可靠性，特别是在处理视觉变化和提供可解释评分方面表现出色。

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) aims to evaluate and score sports actions, which has attracted widespread interest in recent years. Existing AQA methods primarily predict scores based on features extracted from the entire video, resulting in limited interpretability and reliability. Meanwhile, existing AQA datasets also lack fine-grained annotations for action scores, especially for deduction items and sub-score annotations. In this paper, we construct the first AQA dataset containing fine-grained sub-score and deduction annotations for aerial skiing, which will be released as a new benchmark. For the technical challenges, we propose a novel AQA method, named JudgeMind, which significantly enhances performance and reliability by simulating the judgment and scoring mindset of professional referees. Our method segments the input action video into different stages and scores each stage to enhance accuracy. Then, we propose a stage-aware feature enhancement and fusion module to boost the perception of stage-specific key regions and enhance the robustness to visual changes caused by frequent camera viewpoints switching. In addition, we propose a knowledge-based grade-aware decoder to incorporate possible deduction items as prior knowledge to predict more accurate and reliable scores. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 传统面部情感识别缺乏可解释的细粒度推理，现有视觉语言模型存在幻觉推理和情感推理与识别不对齐的问题。

Method: 采用三阶段对齐框架：1）指令微调建立基本情感推理能力；2）强化训练以情感和AU标签为奖励信号对齐推理过程；3）数据合成管道迭代扩展训练数据集。

Result: 在八个标准基准测试中实现最先进性能，构建了包含17,737训练和1,688测试样本的FEA-20K数据集，展现出强大的泛化能力和鲁棒可解释性。

Conclusion: Facial-R1框架有效解决了面部情感分析中的关键挑战，通过最小监督实现了推理与识别的对齐，为可解释情感分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Facial Emotion Analysis (FEA) extends traditional facial emotion recognition by incorporating explainable, fine-grained reasoning. The task integrates three subtasks: emotion recognition, facial Action Unit (AU) recognition, and AU-based emotion reasoning to model affective states jointly. While recent approaches leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and achieve promising results, they face two critical limitations: (1) hallucinated reasoning, where VLMs generate plausible but inaccurate explanations due to insufficient emotion-specific knowledge; and (2) misalignment between emotion reasoning and recognition, caused by fragmented connections between observed facial features and final labels. We propose Facial-R1, a three-stage alignment framework that effectively addresses both challenges with minimal supervision. First, we employ instruction fine-tuning to establish basic emotional reasoning capability. Second, we introduce reinforcement training guided by emotion and AU labels as reward signals, which explicitly aligns the generated reasoning process with the predicted emotion. Third, we design a data synthesis pipeline that iteratively leverages the prior stages to expand the training dataset, enabling scalable self-improvement of the model. Built upon this framework, we introduce FEA-20K, a benchmark dataset comprising 17,737 training and 1,688 test samples with fine-grained emotion analysis annotations. Extensive experiments across eight standard benchmarks demonstrate that Facial-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in FEA, with strong generalization and robust interpretability.

TL;DR: H3Former是一个用于细粒度视觉分类的新框架，通过语义感知聚合模块和双曲层次对比损失，有效捕获高阶语义关系并提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的细粒度视觉分类方法通常依赖特征选择机制或区域提议策略来定位判别性区域，但往往无法全面捕获判别性线索，同时引入大量类别无关的冗余信息。

Method: 提出H3Former框架，包含语义感知聚合模块(SAAM)和双曲层次对比损失(HHCL)。SAAM利用多尺度上下文线索动态构建token间的加权超图，通过超图卷积捕获高阶语义依赖；HHCL在非欧几里得嵌入空间中强制层次语义约束。

Result: 在四个标准FGVC基准测试上进行的综合实验验证了H3Former框架的优越性。

Conclusion: H3Former通过token到区域的框架，利用高阶语义关系聚合局部细粒度表示，结合结构化区域级建模，有效解决了细粒度视觉分类中的挑战。

Abstract: Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) remains a challenging task due to subtle inter-class differences and large intra-class variations. Existing approaches typically rely on feature-selection mechanisms or region-proposal strategies to localize discriminative regions for semantic analysis. However, these methods often fail to capture discriminative cues comprehensively while introducing substantial category-agnostic redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose H3Former, a novel token-to-region framework that leverages high-order semantic relations to aggregate local fine-grained representations with structured region-level modeling. Specifically, we propose the Semantic-Aware Aggregation Module (SAAM), which exploits multi-scale contextual cues to dynamically construct a weighted hypergraph among tokens. By applying hypergraph convolution, SAAM captures high-order semantic dependencies and progressively aggregates token features into compact region-level representations. Furthermore, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Loss (HHCL), which enforces hierarchical semantic constraints in a non-Euclidean embedding space. The HHCL enhances inter-class separability and intra-class consistency while preserving the intrinsic hierarchical relationships among fine-grained categories. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four standard FGVC benchmarks validate the superiority of our H3Former framework.

TL;DR: RUDDER是一个低开销框架，通过提取自注意力层的残差更新作为视觉证据向量，并结合贝叶斯自适应门控机制，在大视觉语言模型中减少对象幻觉问题，同时保持计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大视觉语言模型存在对象幻觉问题，生成与视觉输入不一致的文本，严重影响可靠性。现有的推理时干预方法虽然有效，但计算开销大，限制了在实际延迟敏感场景中的应用。

Method: 提出RUDDER框架，包含两个关键创新：1) 上下文激活残差方向(CARD)向量，在单次前向传播中从自注意力层残差更新提取视觉证据；2) 贝叶斯启发的自适应门控，根据模型偏离视觉上下文程度进行token级校正信号注入。

Result: 在POPE和CHAIR等关键幻觉基准测试中，RUDDER实现了与最先进方法相当的性能，同时引入了可忽略的计算延迟。

Conclusion: RUDDER是一种实用有效的框架，可在不显著牺牲效率的情况下提高大视觉语言模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from object hallucination, generating text inconsistent with visual inputs, which can critically undermine their reliability. Existing inference-time interventions to mitigate this issue present a challenging trade-off: while methods that steer internal states or adjust output logits can be effective, they often incur substantial computational overhead, typically requiring extra forward passes. This efficiency bottleneck can limit their practicality for real-world, latency-sensitive deployments. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off with Residual-Update Directed DEcoding Regulation (RUDDER), a low-overhead framework that steers LVLMs towards visually-grounded generation. RUDDER is built on two key innovations: (1) Contextual Activation Residual Direction (CARD) vector, a per-sample visual evidence vector extracted from the residual update of a self-attention layer during a single, standard forward pass. (2) A Bayesian-inspired adaptive gate that performs token-wise injection, applying a corrective signal whose strength is conditioned on the model's deviation from the visual context. Extensive experiments on key hallucination benchmarks, including POPE and CHAIR, indicate that RUDDER achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while introducing negligible computational latency, validating RUDDER as a pragmatic and effective approach for improving LVLMs' reliability without a significant compromise on efficiency.

Motivation: 卫星贫民窟分割对全球城市贫困估计具有重要意义，但非正规住区的形态异质性导致模型难以泛化到未见区域，需要解决跨区域适应性问题。

Method: 构建了来自4大洲12个城市的百万规模高分辨率卫星图像数据集，采用专家混合架构捕获区域特定特征，通过两阶段测试时适应框架利用预测一致性过滤不可靠伪标签。

Result: GRAM在低资源设置下（如非洲城市）优于最先进的基线方法，为全球贫民窟测绘提供了可扩展且标签高效的解决方案。

Conclusion: GRAM框架能够在不需目标区域标注数据的情况下实现稳健的贫民窟分割，为数据驱动的城市规划提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Satellite-based slum segmentation holds significant promise in generating global estimates of urban poverty. However, the morphological heterogeneity of informal settlements presents a major challenge, hindering the ability of models trained on specific regions to generalize effectively to unseen locations. To address this, we introduce a large-scale high-resolution dataset and propose GRAM (Generalized Region-Aware Mixture-of-Experts), a two-phase test-time adaptation framework that enables robust slum segmentation without requiring labeled data from target regions. We compile a million-scale satellite imagery dataset from 12 cities across four continents for source training. Using this dataset, the model employs a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to capture region-specific slum characteristics while learning universal features through a shared backbone. During adaptation, prediction consistency across experts filters out unreliable pseudo-labels, allowing the model to generalize effectively to previously unseen regions. GRAM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in low-resource settings such as African cities, offering a scalable and label-efficient solution for global slum mapping and data-driven urban planning.

Motivation: 解决LLaVA架构中文本和视觉模态不匹配导致的视觉特征整合效果不佳的问题，从新的角度探索大语言模型作为视觉编码器的潜力。

Method: 通过三个关键修改：1）为视觉模态学习独立的QKV投影；2）在视觉令牌上启用双向注意力；3）结合全局和局部视觉表示。

Result: 在广泛的LLM上进行控制实验，LLaViT在多个基准测试中显著优于基线LLaVA方法，甚至超过了参数数量翻倍的模型。

Conclusion: LLaViT为视觉语言建模建立了一种更有效的方法，证明了大语言模型可以同时作为强大的视觉编码器。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of the LLaVA architecture for vision-language tasks, its design inherently struggles to effectively integrate visual features due to the inherent mismatch between text and vision modalities. We tackle this issue from a novel perspective in which the LLM not only serves as a language model but also a powerful vision encoder. To this end, we present LLaViT - Large Language Models as extended Vision Transformers - which enables the LLM to simultaneously function as a vision encoder through three key modifications: (1) learning separate QKV projections for vision modality, (2) enabling bidirectional attention on visual tokens, and (3) incorporating both global and local visual representations. Through extensive controlled experiments on a wide range of LLMs, we demonstrate that LLaViT significantly outperforms the baseline LLaVA method on a multitude of benchmarks, even surpassing models with double its parameter count, establishing a more effective approach to vision-language modeling.

Motivation: 现有方法无法同时解决远距离区域深度估计不准确和近距离区域结构退化的问题，特别是在具有极端深度变化的场景中。

Method: 采用两个核心组件：1）景深监督使用尺度恢复的单目深度估计器生成深度先验，利用散焦卷积合成物理准确的散焦图像，通过景深损失增强几何一致性；2）多视角一致性监督使用基于LoFTR的半稠密特征匹配来最小化跨视角几何误差，并通过可靠匹配点的最小二乘优化强制深度一致性。

Conclusion: 该框架将散焦物理与多视角几何约束相结合，为城市环境中复杂深度分层提供了可扩展的解决方案，弥合了物理成像原理与基于学习的深度正则化之间的差距。

Abstract: Three-dimensional reconstruction in scenes with extreme depth variations remains challenging due to inconsistent supervisory signals between near-field and far-field regions. Existing methods fail to simultaneously address inaccurate depth estimation in distant areas and structural degradation in close-range regions. This paper proposes a novel computational framework that integrates depth-of-field supervision and multi-view consistency supervision to advance 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach comprises two core components: (1) Depth-of-field Supervision employs a scale-recovered monocular depth estimator (e.g., Metric3D) to generate depth priors, leverages defocus convolution to synthesize physically accurate defocused images, and enforces geometric consistency through a novel depth-of-field loss, thereby enhancing depth fidelity in both far-field and near-field regions; (2) Multi-View Consistency Supervision employing LoFTR-based semi-dense feature matching to minimize cross-view geometric errors and enforce depth consistency via least squares optimization of reliable matched points. By unifying defocus physics with multi-view geometric constraints, our method achieves superior depth fidelity, demonstrating a 0.8 dB PSNR improvement over the state-of-the-art method on the Waymo Open Dataset. This framework bridges physical imaging principles and learning-based depth regularization, offering a scalable solution for complex depth stratification in urban environments.

Abstract: Single Domain Generalization (SDG) for object detection aims to train a model on a single source domain that can generalize effectively to unseen target domains. While recent methods like CLIP-based semantic augmentation have shown promise, they often overlook the underlying structure of feature distributions and frequency-domain characteristics that are critical for robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances SDG object detection by integrating the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution and Fourier transformation into a CLIP-guided pipeline. Specifically, we model the directional features of object representations using vMF to better capture domain-invariant semantic structures in the embedding space. Additionally, we introduce a Fourier-based augmentation strategy that perturbs amplitude and phase components to simulate domain shifts in the frequency domain, further improving feature robustness. Our method not only preserves the semantic alignment benefits of CLIP but also enriches feature diversity and structural consistency across domains. Extensive experiments on the diverse weather-driving benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: AI-based dermatology adoption remains limited by biased datasets, variable image quality, and limited validation. We introduce DermAI, a lightweight, smartphone-based application that enables real-time capture, annotation, and classification of skin lesions during routine consultations.

The DermAI clinical dataset, encompasses a wide range of skin tones, ethinicity and source devices. In preliminary experiments, models trained on public datasets failed to generalize to our samples, while fine-tuning with local data improved performance.

Motivation: 地理空间基础模型在预训练期间代表性不足的环境中往往表现不可靠，需要开发能够识别和缓解这种不可靠性的方法。

Method: 整合三种互补信号：输入空间的分布外检测、嵌入空间的分布外检测和任务特定的预测不确定性，应用于烧伤疤痕分割任务。

Conclusion: SHRUG-FM为在气候敏感应用中更安全、更可解释地部署地理空间基础模型提供了途径，有助于弥合基准性能与现实世界可靠性之间的差距。

Abstract: Geospatial foundation models for Earth observation often fail to perform reliably in environments underrepresented during pretraining. We introduce SHRUG-FM, a framework for reliability-aware prediction that integrates three complementary signals: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in the input space, OOD detection in the embedding space and task-specific predictive uncertainty. Applied to burn scar segmentation, SHRUG-FM shows that OOD scores correlate with lower performance in specific environmental conditions, while uncertainty-based flags help discard many poorly performing predictions. Linking these flags to land cover attributes from HydroATLAS shows that failures are not random but concentrated in certain geographies, such as low-elevation zones and large river areas, likely due to underrepresentation in pretraining data. SHRUG-FM provides a pathway toward safer and more interpretable deployment of GFMs in climate-sensitive applications, helping bridge the gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability.

Conclusion: MSGNav系统有效解决了零样本导航中的视觉信息保留和最后一英里问题，为机器人具身导航提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Embodied navigation is a fundamental capability for robotic agents operating. Real-world deployment requires open vocabulary generalization and low training overhead, motivating zero-shot methods rather than task-specific RL training. However, existing zero-shot methods that build explicit 3D scene graphs often compress rich visual observations into text-only relations, leading to high construction cost, irreversible loss of visual evidence, and constrained vocabularies. To address these limitations, we introduce the Multi-modal 3D Scene Graph (M3DSG), which preserves visual cues by replacing textual relational edges with dynamically assigned images. Built on M3DSG, we propose MSGNav, a zero-shot navigation system that includes a Key Subgraph Selection module for efficient reasoning, an Adaptive Vocabulary Update module for open vocabulary support, and a Closed-Loop Reasoning module for accurate exploration reasoning. Additionally, we further identify the last-mile problem in zero-shot navigation - determining the feasible target location with a suitable final viewpoint, and propose a Visibility-based Viewpoint Decision module to explicitly resolve it. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that MSGNav achieves state-of-the-art performance on GOAT-Bench and HM3D-OVON datasets. The open-source code will be publicly available.

Method: 提出了AntiDB_Purify评估框架，系统评估现有防御方法在传统图像滤波和对抗净化威胁下的有效性。

Result: 研究发现当前所有防御方法在净化威胁下都失去保护效果，无法有效防止用户身份泄露。

Conclusion: 现有防御方法提供虚假安全感，迫切需要开发更隐蔽和鲁棒的保护机制来保障个性化生成中的用户身份安全。

Abstract: Personalized AI applications such as DreamBooth enable the generation of customized content from user images, but also raise significant privacy concerns, particularly the risk of facial identity leakage. Recent defense mechanisms like Anti-DreamBooth attempt to mitigate this risk by injecting adversarial perturbations into user photos to prevent successful personalization. However, we identify two critical yet overlooked limitations of these methods. First, the adversarial examples often exhibit perceptible artifacts such as conspicuous patterns or stripes, making them easily detectable as manipulated content. Second, the perturbations are highly fragile, as even a simple, non-learned filter can effectively remove them, thereby restoring the model's ability to memorize and reproduce user identity. To investigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel evaluation framework, AntiDB_Purify, to systematically evaluate existing defenses under realistic purification threats, including both traditional image filters and adversarial purification. Results reveal that none of the current methods maintains their protective effectiveness under such threats. These findings highlight that current defenses offer a false sense of security and underscore the urgent need for more imperceptible and robust protections to safeguard user identity in personalized generation.

Abstract: Lane detection is an important topic in the future mobility solutions. Real-world environmental challenges such as background clutter, varying illumination, and occlusions pose significant obstacles to effective lane detection, particularly when relying on data-driven approaches that require substantial effort and cost for data collection and annotation. To address these issues, lane detection methods must leverage contextual and global information from surrounding lanes and objects. In this paper, we propose a Spatial Attention Mutual Information Regularization with a pre-trained model as an Oracle, called SAMIRO. SAMIRO enhances lane detection performance by transferring knowledge from a pretrained model while preserving domain-agnostic spatial information. Leveraging SAMIRO's plug-and-play characteristic, we integrate it into various state-of-the-art lane detection approaches and conduct extensive experiments on major benchmarks such as CULane, Tusimple, and LLAMAS. The results demonstrate that SAMIRO consistently improves performance across different models and datasets. The code will be made available upon publication.

TL;DR: MonkeyOCR v1.5是一个统一的视觉语言框架，通过两阶段解析流程增强文档布局理解和内容识别，在复杂布局文档解析方面实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界文档通常具有复杂布局，包含多级表格、嵌入式图像或公式以及跨页结构，这对现有OCR系统构成挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段解析流程：第一阶段使用大型多模态模型联合预测文档布局和阅读顺序；第二阶段在检测区域内执行文本、公式和表格的局部识别。针对复杂表格结构，提出基于视觉一致性的强化学习方案和两个专门模块（图像解耦表格解析和类型引导表格合并）。

Result: 在OmniDocBench v1.5上的综合实验表明，MonkeyOCR v1.5实现了最先进的性能，优于PPOCR-VL和MinerU 2.5，在视觉复杂文档场景中表现出卓越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MonkeyOCR v1.5通过统一的视觉语言框架和创新的表格处理技术，有效解决了复杂文档解析的挑战，为文档智能应用提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: Document parsing is a core task in document intelligence, supporting applications such as information extraction, retrieval-augmented generation, and automated document analysis. However, real-world documents often feature complex layouts with multi-level tables, embedded images or formulas, and cross-page structures, which remain challenging for existing OCR systems. We introduce MonkeyOCR v1.5, a unified vision-language framework that enhances both layout understanding and content recognition through a two-stage parsing pipeline. The first stage employs a large multimodal model to jointly predict document layout and reading order, leveraging visual information to ensure structural and sequential consistency. The second stage performs localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables within detected regions, maintaining high visual fidelity while reducing error propagation. To address complex table structures, we propose a visual consistency-based reinforcement learning scheme that evaluates recognition quality via render-and-compare alignment, improving structural accuracy without manual annotations. Additionally, two specialized modules, Image-Decoupled Table Parsing and Type-Guided Table Merging, are introduced to enable reliable parsing of tables containing embedded images and reconstruction of tables crossing pages or columns. Comprehensive experiments on OmniDocBench v1.5 demonstrate that MonkeyOCR v1.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming PPOCR-VL and MinerU 2.5 while showing exceptional robustness in visually complex document scenarios.

Abstract: The health condition of wind turbine (WT) components is crucial for ensuring stable and reliable operation. However, existing fault detection methods are largely limited to visual recognition, producing structured outputs that lack semantic interpretability and fail to support maintenance decision-making. To address these limitations, this study proposes an integrated framework that combines YOLOMS with a large language model (LLM) for intelligent fault analysis and diagnosis. Specifically, YOLOMS employs multi-scale detection and sliding-window cropping to enhance fault feature extraction, while a lightweight key-value (KV) mapping module bridges the gap between visual outputs and textual inputs. This module converts YOLOMS detection results into structured textual representations enriched with both qualitative and quantitative attributes. A domain-tuned LLM then performs semantic reasoning to generate interpretable fault analyses and maintenance recommendations. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a fault detection accuracy of 90.6\% and generates maintenance reports with an average accuracy of 89\%, thereby improving the interpretability of diagnostic results and providing practical decision support for the operation and maintenance of wind turbines.

Abstract: Acquiring standard facial planes during routine fetal ultrasound (US) examinations is often challenging due to fetal movement, variability in orientation, and operator-dependent expertise. These factors contribute to inconsistencies, increased examination time, and potential diagnostic bias.
  To address these challenges in the context of facial assessment, we present: 1) GT++, a robust algorithm that estimates standard facial planes from 3D US volumes using annotated anatomical landmarks; and 2) 3DFETUS, a deep learning model that automates and standardizes their localization in 3D fetal US volumes.
  We evaluated our methods both qualitatively, through expert clinical review, and quantitatively. The proposed approach achieved a mean translation error of 4.13 mm and a mean rotation error of 7.93 degrees per plane, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods on 3D US volumes. Clinical assessments further confirmed the effectiveness of both GT++ and 3DFETUS, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in plane estimation accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce a curated video dataset of laboratory rodents for automatic detection of convulsive events. The dataset contains short (10~s) top-down and side-view video clips of individual rodents, labeled at clip level as normal activity or seizure. It includes 10,101 negative samples and 2,952 positive samples collected from 19 subjects. We describe the data curation, annotation protocol and preprocessing pipeline, and report baseline experiments using a transformer-based video classifier (TimeSformer).

Results show that the TimeSformer architecture enables discrimination between seizure and normal activity with an average F1-score of 97%. The dataset and baseline code are publicly released to support reproducible research on non-invasive, video-based monitoring in preclinical epilepsy research.

Motivation: 传统数字病理学管道依赖基于网格的切片方法，忽略了组织结构，引入了无关信息并限制了可解释性。

Method: 使用语义分割从全切片图像中提取腺体作为生物学意义明确的输入补丁，应用于多实例学习和表型分析。

Result: HIT在腺体级别Dice得分为0.83±0.17，从760个WSI中提取38万个腺体，将MIL模型检测EMT和MYC相关基因CNV的AUC提高了10%，并识别出15个腺体簇，多个簇与癌症复发、致癌突变和高Gleason评分相关。

Conclusion: HIT通过聚焦于生物学意义明确的结构进行特征提取，提高了MIL预测的准确性和可解释性，同时简化了计算。

Abstract: Histopathologists establish cancer grade by assessing histological structures, such as glands in prostate cancer. Yet, digital pathology pipelines often rely on grid-based tiling that ignores tissue architecture. This introduces irrelevant information and limits interpretability. We introduce histology-informed tiling (HIT), which uses semantic segmentation to extract glands from whole slide images (WSIs) as biologically meaningful input patches for multiple-instance learning (MIL) and phenotyping. Trained on 137 samples from the ProMPT cohort, HIT achieved a gland-level Dice score of 0.83 +/- 0.17. By extracting 380,000 glands from 760 WSIs across ICGC-C and TCGA-PRAD cohorts, HIT improved MIL models AUCs by 10% for detecting copy number variation (CNVs) in genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) and MYC, and revealed 15 gland clusters, several of which were associated with cancer relapse, oncogenic mutations, and high Gleason. Therefore, HIT improved the accuracy and interpretability of MIL predictions, while streamlining computations by focussing on biologically meaningful structures during feature extraction.

Conclusion: OpenSR-SRGAN作为一个实用工具和基准实现，而非最先进模型，使基于GAN的超分辨率更易于配置、扩展和应用。

Abstract: We present OpenSR-SRGAN, an open and modular framework for single-image super-resolution in Earth Observation. The software provides a unified implementation of SRGAN-style models that is easy to configure, extend, and apply to multispectral satellite data such as Sentinel-2. Instead of requiring users to modify model code, OpenSR-SRGAN exposes generators, discriminators, loss functions, and training schedules through concise configuration files, making it straightforward to switch between architectures, scale factors, and band setups. The framework is designed as a practical tool and benchmark implementation rather than a state-of-the-art model. It ships with ready-to-use configurations for common remote sensing scenarios, sensible default settings for adversarial training, and built-in hooks for logging, validation, and large-scene inference. By turning GAN-based super-resolution into a configuration-driven workflow, OpenSR-SRGAN lowers the entry barrier for researchers and practitioners who wish to experiment with SRGANs, compare models in a reproducible way, and deploy super-resolution pipelines across diverse Earth-observation datasets.

Motivation: 2型糖尿病早期检测至关重要，但胰腺表面分叶度在T2DM患者中的作用尚未得到充分研究。本研究旨在探索PSL作为T2DM筛查生物标志物的潜力。

Method: 使用四种深度学习模型在584名患者内部数据集上分割胰腺，自动检测PSL，并开发多变量模型利用CT生物标志物预测T2DM。

Result: 糖尿病患者PSL显著更高（4.26±8.32 vs 3.19±3.62，p=0.01）。PancAP模型获得最高Dice分数0.79±0.17和最低ASSD误差1.94±2.63mm。T2DM预测模型达到0.90 AUC、66.7%敏感性和91.9%特异性。

Conclusion: PSL可用于T2DM筛查，并可能帮助预测T2DM的早期发病。全自动CT成像生物标志物提取方法为糖尿病筛查提供了有前景的工具。

Abstract: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection is crucial as it can alter pancreas function through morphological changes and increased deposition of ectopic fat, eventually leading to organ damage. While studies have shown an association between T2DM and pancreas volume and fat content, the role of increased pancreatic surface lobularity (PSL) in patients with T2DM has not been fully investigated. In this pilot work, we propose a fully automated approach to delineate the pancreas and other abdominal structures, derive CT imaging biomarkers, and opportunistically screen for T2DM. Four deep learning-based models were used to segment the pancreas in an internal dataset of 584 patients (297 males, 437 non-diabetic, age: 45$\pm$15 years). PSL was automatically detected and it was higher for diabetic patients (p=0.01) at 4.26 $\pm$ 8.32 compared to 3.19 $\pm$ 3.62 for non-diabetic patients. The PancAP model achieved the highest Dice score of 0.79 $\pm$ 0.17 and lowest ASSD error of 1.94 $\pm$ 2.63 mm (p$<$0.05). For predicting T2DM, a multivariate model trained with CT biomarkers attained 0.90 AUC, 66.7\% sensitivity, and 91.9\% specificity. Our results suggest that PSL is useful for T2DM screening and could potentially help predict the early onset of T2DM.

Abstract: While Vision Transformers (ViT) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks, their computational demands are substantial, scaling quadratically with the number of processed tokens. Compact attention representations, reflecting token interaction distributions, can guide early detection and reduction of less salient tokens prior to attention computation. Motivated by this, we present SParsification with attentiOn dynamics via Token relevance (SPOT), a framework for early detection of redundant tokens within ViTs that leverages token embeddings, interactions, and attention dynamics across layers to infer token importance, resulting in a more context-aware and interpretable relevance detection process. SPOT informs token sparsification and facilitates the elimination of such tokens, improving computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. SPOT employs computationally lightweight predictors that can be plugged into various ViT architectures and learn to derive effective input-specific token prioritization across layers. Its versatile design supports a range of performance levels adaptable to varying resource constraints. Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant efficiency gains of up to 40% compared to standard ViTs, while maintaining or even improving accuracy.

Conclusion: SemanticVLA通过语义对齐的稀疏化和增强，有效解决了VLA模型在机器人操作中的关键限制，在性能和效率方面均实现了显著提升。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced in robotic manipulation, yet practical deployment remains hindered by two key limitations: 1) perceptual redundancy, where irrelevant visual inputs are processed inefficiently, and 2) superficial instruction-vision alignment, which hampers semantic grounding of actions. In this paper, we propose SemanticVLA, a novel VLA framework that performs Semantic-Aligned Sparsification and Enhancement for Efficient Robotic Manipulation. Specifically: 1) To sparsify redundant perception while preserving semantic alignment, Semantic-guided Dual Visual Pruner (SD-Pruner) performs: Instruction-driven Pruner (ID-Pruner) extracts global action cues and local semantic anchors in SigLIP; Spatial-aggregation Pruner (SA-Pruner) compacts geometry-rich features into task-adaptive tokens in DINOv2. 2) To exploit sparsified features and integrate semantics with spatial geometry, Semantic-complementary Hierarchical Fuser (SH-Fuser) fuses dense patches and sparse tokens across SigLIP and DINOv2 for coherent representation. 3) To enhance the transformation from perception to action, Semantic-conditioned Action Coupler (SA-Coupler) replaces the conventional observation-to-DoF approach, yielding more efficient and interpretable behavior modeling for manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on simulation and real-world tasks show that SemanticVLA sets a new SOTA in both performance and efficiency. SemanticVLA surpasses OpenVLA on LIBERO benchmark by 21.1% in success rate, while reducing training cost and inference latency by 3.0-fold and 2.7-fold.SemanticVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/SemanticVLA

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic humans interacting with real-world environments from monocular videos is an important and challenging task. Despite considerable progress in 4D neural rendering, existing approaches either model dynamic scenes holistically or model scenes and backgrounds separately aim to introduce parametric human priors. However, these approaches either neglect distinct motion characteristics of various components in scene especially human, leading to incomplete reconstructions, or ignore the information exchange between the separately modeled components, resulting in spatial inconsistencies and visual artifacts at human-scene boundaries. To address this, we propose {\bf Separate-then-Map} (StM) strategy that introduces a dedicated information mapping mechanism to bridge separately defined and optimized models. Our method employs a shared transformation function for each Gaussian attribute to unify separately modeled components, enhancing computational efficiency by avoiding exhaustive pairwise interactions while ensuring spatial and visual coherence between humans and their surroundings. Extensive experiments on monocular video datasets demonstrate that StM significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and rendering accuracy, particularly at challenging human-scene interaction boundaries.

Abstract: Despite advances in generation quality, current text-to-image (T2I) models often lack diversity, generating homogeneous outputs. This work introduces a framework to address the need for robust diversity evaluation in T2I models. Our framework systematically assesses diversity by evaluating individual concepts and their relevant factors of variation. Key contributions include: (1) a novel human evaluation template for nuanced diversity assessment; (2) a curated prompt set covering diverse concepts with their identified factors of variation (e.g. prompt: An image of an apple, factor of variation: color); and (3) a methodology for comparing models in terms of human annotations via binomial tests.
  Furthermore, we rigorously compare various image embeddings for diversity measurement. Notably, our principled approach enables ranking of T2I models by diversity, identifying categories where they particularly struggle. This research offers a robust methodology and insights, paving the way for improvements in T2I model diversity and metric development.

Abstract: Innovative visual stylization is a cornerstone of artistic creation, yet generating novel and consistent visual styles remains a significant challenge. Existing generative approaches typically rely on lengthy textual prompts, reference images, or parameter-efficient fine-tuning to guide style-aware image generation, but often struggle with style consistency, limited creativity, and complex style representations. In this paper, we affirm that a style is worth one numerical code by introducing the novel task, code-to-style image generation, which produces images with novel, consistent visual styles conditioned solely on a numerical style code. To date, this field has only been primarily explored by the industry (e.g., Midjourney), with no open-source research from the academic community. To fill this gap, we propose CoTyle, the first open-source method for this task. Specifically, we first train a discrete style codebook from a collection of images to extract style embeddings. These embeddings serve as conditions for a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I-DM) to generate stylistic images. Subsequently, we train an autoregressive style generator on the discrete style embeddings to model their distribution, allowing the synthesis of novel style embeddings. During inference, a numerical style code is mapped to a unique style embedding by the style generator, and this embedding guides the T2I-DM to generate images in the corresponding style. Unlike existing methods, our method offers unparalleled simplicity and diversity, unlocking a vast space of reproducible styles from minimal input. Extensive experiments validate that CoTyle effectively turns a numerical code into a style controller, demonstrating a style is worth one code.

Result: 在单目/多视角深度估计、多视角立体视觉和相机姿态估计等任务上优于现有方法，即使仅使用RGB输入也达到SOTA；集成到VLA模型中在机器人任务上获得持续提升。

Conclusion: OmniVGGT通过有效利用几何模态信息，显著提升了3D基础模型的性能，同时保持了高效的推理速度，在多种视觉任务和机器人应用中展现出实用价值。

Abstract: General 3D foundation models have started to lead the trend of unifying diverse vision tasks, yet most assume RGB-only inputs and ignore readily available geometric cues (e.g., camera intrinsics, poses, and depth maps). To address this issue, we introduce OmniVGGT, a novel framework that can effectively benefit from an arbitrary number of auxiliary geometric modalities during both training and inference. In our framework, a GeoAdapter is proposed to encode depth and camera intrinsics/extrinsics into a spatial foundation model. It employs zero-initialized convolutions to progressively inject geometric information without disrupting the foundation model's representation space. This design ensures stable optimization with negligible overhead, maintaining inference speed comparable to VGGT even with multiple additional inputs. Additionally, a stochastic multimodal fusion regimen is proposed, which randomly samples modality subsets per instance during training. This enables an arbitrary number of modality inputs during testing and promotes learning robust spatial representations instead of overfitting to auxiliary cues. Comprehensive experiments on monocular/multi-view depth estimation, multi-view stereo, and camera pose estimation demonstrate that OmniVGGT outperforms prior methods with auxiliary inputs and achieves state-of-the-art results even with RGB-only input. To further highlight its practical utility, we integrated OmniVGGT into vision-language-action (VLA) models. The enhanced VLA model by OmniVGGT not only outperforms the vanilla point-cloud-based baseline on mainstream benchmarks, but also effectively leverages accessible auxiliary inputs to achieve consistent gains on robotic tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的多任务全局-局部OBIA-Mamba模型，用于提升Sentinel-2影像的土地利用分类性能，通过结合超像素分割、双分支CNN-Mamba架构和多任务优化来解决空间异质性和上下文信息等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sentinel-2影像的土地利用分类面临空间异质性、上下文信息和特征模糊性等关键数据挑战，需要开发更有效的分类方法来提高精度和细节保留能力。

Method: 设计了三种关键技术：1）基于对象的Mamba模型，使用超像素作为Mamba标记减少冗余计算；2）全局-局部双分支CNN-Mamba架构，联合建模局部空间细节和全局上下文信息；3）多任务优化框架，使用双损失函数平衡局部精度和全局一致性。

Result: 在加拿大阿尔伯塔省的Sentinel-2影像上进行测试，与多种先进分类方法比较，结果表明所提方法获得了更高的分类精度和更精细的细节。

Conclusion: 提出的MSOM方法能够有效提升Sentinel-2影像的土地利用分类性能，在保持精细细节的同时实现更高的分类准确性，优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Although Sentinel-2 based land use and land cover (LULC) classification is critical for various environmental monitoring applications, it is a very difficult task due to some key data challenges (e.g., spatial heterogeneity, context information, signature ambiguity). This paper presents a novel Multitask Glocal OBIA-Mamba (MSOM) for enhanced Sentinel-2 classification with the following contributions. First, an object-based image analysis (OBIA) Mamba model (OBIA-Mamba) is designed to reduce redundant computation without compromising fine-grained details by using superpixels as Mamba tokens. Second, a global-local (GLocal) dual-branch convolutional neural network (CNN)-mamba architecture is designed to jointly model local spatial detail and global contextual information. Third, a multitask optimization framework is designed to employ dual loss functions to balance local precision with global consistency. The proposed approach is tested on Sentinel-2 imagery in Alberta, Canada, in comparison with several advanced classification approaches, and the results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves higher classification accuracy and finer details that the other state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Omnilingual ASR，首个专为可扩展性设计的大规模自动语音识别系统，能够仅用少量数据样本支持未服务语言，覆盖1600多种语言，包括500多种首次获得ASR支持的语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高资源语言ASR快速发展而大多数世界语言（7000+）缺乏支持的问题，突破传统架构限制语言支持的局限性，同时关注社区合作的伦理考量。

Method: 采用7B参数的自监督预训练学习鲁棒语音表示，引入专为零样本泛化设计的编码器-解码器架构，利用LLM启发的解码器，结合大规模多样化训练语料。

Result: 自动评估显示在低资源条件下相比先前系统有显著提升，表现出强大泛化能力，模型家族从300M到7B参数，适用于不同设备需求。

Conclusion: 开源模型和工具可以降低研究者和社区的参与门槛，促进新的参与形式，同时反思了影响设计的伦理考量和社会影响。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has advanced in high-resource languages, but most of the world's 7,000+ languages remain unsupported, leaving thousands of long-tail languages behind. Expanding ASR coverage has been costly and limited by architectures that restrict language support, making extension inaccessible to most--all while entangled with ethical concerns when pursued without community collaboration. To transcend these limitations, we introduce Omnilingual ASR, the first large-scale ASR system designed for extensibility. Omnilingual ASR enables communities to introduce unserved languages with only a handful of data samples. It scales self-supervised pre-training to 7B parameters to learn robust speech representations and introduces an encoder-decoder architecture designed for zero-shot generalization, leveraging a LLM-inspired decoder. This capability is grounded in a massive and diverse training corpus; by combining breadth of coverage with linguistic variety, the model learns representations robust enough to adapt to unseen languages. Incorporating public resources with community-sourced recordings gathered through compensated local partnerships, Omnilingual ASR expands coverage to over 1,600 languages, the largest such effort to date--including over 500 never before served by ASR. Automatic evaluations show substantial gains over prior systems, especially in low-resource conditions, and strong generalization. We release Omnilingual ASR as a family of models, from 300M variants for low-power devices to 7B for maximum accuracy. We reflect on the ethical considerations shaping this design and conclude by discussing its societal impact. In particular, we highlight how open-sourcing models and tools can lower barriers for researchers and communities, inviting new forms of participation.

TL;DR: 研究发现示例排序对上下文学习性能的影响与示例选择相当，挑战了传统认为示例选择更重要的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视上下文学习中示例选择比排序更重要的传统假设，通过系统比较两者对性能的影响。

Method: 在分类和生成任务上进行控制实验，使用多个开源模型家族（0.5B到27B参数）和GPT-5，比较不同示例排序和选择对性能的方差影响。

Result: 不同示例排序导致的性能方差与使用完全不同示例集相当；使用开发集可以识别强排序，性能接近基于测试标签选择最佳排序的oracle。

Conclusion: 示例选择和排序在提示设计中具有同等且交织的重要性，需要重新审视上下文学习中的传统假设。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models to perform new tasks by conditioning on a sequence of examples. Most prior work reasonably and intuitively assumes that which examples are chosen has a far greater effect on performance than how those examples are ordered, leading to a focus on example selection. We revisit this assumption and conduct a systematic comparison between the effect of selection and ordering. Through controlled experiments on both classification and generation tasks, using multiple open-source model families (0.5B to 27B parameters) and GPT-5, we find that the variance in performance due to different example orderings is comparable to that from using entirely different example sets. Furthermore, we show that strong orderings can be identified using only a development set, achieving performance close to an oracle that selects the best ordering based on test labels. Our findings highlight the equal and intertwined importance of example selection and ordering in prompt design, calling for a reexamination of the assumptions held in ICL.

TL;DR: 该论文研究拉丁语的形态感知分词方法，发现形态学引导的分词能提升下游任务性能，特别是在域外文本上表现更好，证明了语言资源对形态复杂语言建模的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准分词方法通常优先考虑信息理论目标而非语言学目标，对形态丰富的语言效果不佳。拉丁语作为形态丰富但预训练数据中等、词汇资源丰富的语言，是研究形态感知分词的理想案例。

Method: 研究拉丁语的形态感知分词方法，利用其丰富的词汇资源来改进分词过程，使其更符合形态学结构。

Result: 形态学引导的分词在四个下游任务上提高了整体性能，特别是在域外文本上表现提升最明显，表明模型泛化能力得到改善。

Conclusion: 对于缺乏大规模预训练数据的低资源语言，开发和整合语言资源可以作为提高语言模型性能的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Tokenization is a critical component of language model pretraining, yet standard tokenization methods often prioritize information-theoretical goals like high compression and low fertility rather than linguistic goals like morphological alignment. In fact, they have been shown to be suboptimal for morphologically rich languages, where tokenization quality directly impacts downstream performance. In this work, we investigate morphologically-aware tokenization for Latin, a morphologically rich language that is medium-resource in terms of pretraining data, but high-resource in terms of curated lexical resources -- a distinction that is often overlooked but critical in discussions of low-resource language modeling. We find that morphologically-guided tokenization improves overall performance on four downstream tasks. Performance gains are most pronounced for out of domain texts, highlighting our models' improved generalization ability. Our findings demonstrate the utility of linguistic resources to improve language modeling for morphologically complex languages. For low-resource languages that lack large-scale pretraining data, the development and incorporation of linguistic resources can serve as a feasible alternative to improve LM performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了参数规模小于20亿的轻量级语言模型在英德翻译关键错误检测任务中的表现，发现约10亿参数的模型在质量与效率之间达到最佳平衡，其中Gemma-3-1B表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在机器翻译评估方面表现出色，但其规模和成本限制了在边缘设备和隐私敏感工作流中的部署，因此需要探索更小规模的模型是否能有效检测意义改变型翻译错误。

Method: 构建了标准化评估框架，在WMT21、WMT22和SynCED-EnDe-2025数据集上测试多个子20亿参数模型，应用轻量级logit-bias校准和多数投票机制，同时评估语义质量和计算效率指标。

Result: Gemma-3-1B在质量-效率权衡方面表现最佳，在SynCED-EnDe-2025数据集上达到MCC=0.77和F1-ERR=0.98，在MacBook Pro M4 Pro上单样本延迟为400毫秒。Qwen-3-1.7B获得最高绝对MCC但计算成本更高。

Conclusion: 经过指令微调的紧凑型LLM结合轻量级校准和小样本监督，能够为机器翻译提供可信赖的端侧关键错误检测，实现隐私保护、低成本的实时翻译错误筛查。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at evaluating machine translation (MT), but their scale and cost hinder deployment on edge devices and in privacy-sensitive workflows. We ask: how small can you get while still detecting meaning-altering translation errors? Focusing on English->German Critical Error Detection (CED), we benchmark sub-2B models (LFM2-350M, Qwen-3-0.6B/1.7B, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, Gemma-3-1B) across WMT21, WMT22, and SynCED-EnDe-2025. Our framework standardizes prompts, applies lightweight logit-bias calibration and majority voting, and reports both semantic quality (MCC, F1-ERR/F1-NOT) and compute metrics (VRAM, latency, throughput). Results reveal a clear sweet spot around one billion parameters: Gemma-3-1B provides the best quality-efficiency trade-off, reaching MCC=0.77 with F1-ERR=0.98 on SynCED-EnDe-2025 after merged-weights fine-tuning, while maintaining 400 ms single-sample latency on a MacBook Pro M4 Pro (24 GB). At larger scale, Qwen-3-1.7B attains the highest absolute MCC (+0.11 over Gemma) but with higher compute cost. In contrast, ultra-small models (0.6B) remain usable with few-shot calibration yet under-detect entity and number errors. Overall, compact, instruction-tuned LLMs augmented with lightweight calibration and small-sample supervision can deliver trustworthy, on-device CED for MT, enabling private, low-cost error screening in real-world translation pipelines. All datasets, prompts, and scripts are publicly available at our GitHub repository.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言自然语言处理在低资源环境中具有重要价值，但语言差异（特别是类型学上相距较远的语言）阻碍了语言迁移。本文旨在分析中英文在谓词-论元结构上的差异，为跨语言NLP应用提供指导。

Method: 通过分析中英文平行句的谓词-论元结构，提出结构差异分类，并进行注释投影实验（将一种语言的注释投影到对应的平行句中），进行定性和定量分析。

Result: 分析结果显示语言迁移具有明显的不对称性，即从不同语言作为源语言进行注释投影时效果不同，这对跨语言NLP应用中选择源语言具有重要影响。

Conclusion: 语言迁移的不对称性需要在跨语言NLP应用中引起重视，在选择源语言时需要仔细考虑，这也是提出任何跨语言NLP科学声明前需要调查的重要方面。

Abstract: Cross-lingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) has gained significant traction in recent years, offering practical solutions in low-resource settings by transferring linguistic knowledge from resource-rich to low-resource languages. This field leverages techniques like annotation projection and model transfer for language adaptation, supported by multilingual pre-trained language models. However, linguistic divergences hinder language transfer, especially among typologically distant languages. In this paper, we present an analysis of predicate-argument structures in parallel Chinese and English sentences. We explore the alignment and misalignment of predicate annotations, inspecting similarities and differences and proposing a categorization of structural divergences. The analysis and the categorization are supported by a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results of an annotation projection experiment, in which, in turn, one of the two languages has been used as source language to project annotations into the corresponding parallel sentences. The results of this analysis show clearly that language transfer is asymmetric. An aspect that requires attention when it comes to selecting the source language in transfer learning applications and that needs to be investigated before any scientific claim about cross-lingual NLP is proposed.

### [88] [TARG: Training-Free Adaptive Retrieval Gating for Efficient RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09803)
*Yufeng Wang,Lu wei,Haibin Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出TARG方法，通过基于基础模型短文本草稿的轻量级不确定性评分来决定何时进行检索，在保持准确性的同时大幅减少检索次数和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的检索增强生成(RAG)对每个查询都进行检索会降低质量、增加token数量和延迟，需要更智能的检索决策机制。

Method: TARG使用基础模型生成短文本草稿，从草稿的前缀logits计算轻量级不确定性评分（平均token熵、top-1/top-2 logit间隙的边际信号、少量随机前缀的方差），仅在评分超过阈值时触发检索。

Result: 在NQ-Open、TriviaQA和PopQA数据集上，TARG在保持或提高EM/F1的同时，将检索次数减少70-90%，降低端到端延迟，接近Never-RAG的开销水平。

Conclusion: TARG通过训练自适应的检索门控机制，有效平衡了准确性和效率，边际信号在现代指令调优LLMs下是稳健的默认选择，小N方差提供了保守的预算优先替代方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves factuality but retrieving for every query often hurts quality while inflating tokens and latency. We propose Training-free Adaptive Retrieval Gating (TARG), a single-shot policy that decides when to retrieve using only a short, no-context draft from the base model. From the draft's prefix logits, TARG computes lightweight uncertainty scores: mean token entropy, a margin signal derived from the top-1/top-2 logit gap via a monotone link, or small-N variance across a handful of stochastic prefixes, and triggers retrieval only when the score exceeds a threshold. The gate is model agnostic, adds only tens to hundreds of draft tokens, and requires no additional training or auxiliary heads. On NQ-Open, TriviaQA, and PopQA, TARG consistently shifts the accuracy-efficiency frontier: compared with Always-RAG, TARG matches or improves EM/F1 while reducing retrieval by 70-90% and cutting end-to-end latency, and it remains close to Never-RAG in overhead. A central empirical finding is that under modern instruction-tuned LLMs the margin signal is a robust default (entropy compresses as backbones sharpen), with small-N variance offering a conservative, budget-first alternative. We provide ablations over gate type and prefix length and use a delta-latency view to make budget trade-offs explicit.

Abstract: Compared to English and other high-resource languages, spellchecking for Khmer remains an unresolved problem due to several challenges. First, there are misalignments between words in the lexicon and the word segmentation model. Second, a Khmer word can be written in different forms. Third, Khmer compound words are often loosely and easily formed, and these compound words are not always found in the lexicon. Fourth, some proper nouns may be flagged as misspellings due to the absence of a Khmer named-entity recognition (NER) model. Unfortunately, existing solutions do not adequately address these challenges. This paper proposes a holistic approach to the Khmer spellchecking problem by integrating Khmer subword segmentation, Khmer NER, Khmer grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion, and a Khmer language model to tackle these challenges, identify potential correction candidates, and rank the most suitable candidate. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art Khmer spellchecking accuracy of up to 94.4%, compared to existing solutions. The benchmark datasets for Khmer spellchecking and NER tasks in this study will be made publicly available.

Abstract: This paper aims to address the challenge of selecting relevant courses for students by proposing the design and development of a course recommendation system. The course recommendation system utilises a combination of data analytics techniques and machine learning algorithms to recommend courses that align with current industry trends and requirements. In order to provide customised suggestions, the study entails the design and implementation of an extensive algorithmic framework that combines machine learning methods, user preferences, and academic criteria. The system employs data mining and collaborative filtering techniques to examine past courses and individual career goals in order to provide course recommendations. Moreover, to improve the accessibility and usefulness of the recommendation system, special attention is given to the development of an easy-to-use front-end interface. The front-end design prioritises visual clarity, interaction, and simplicity through iterative prototyping and user input revisions, guaranteeing a smooth and captivating user experience. We refined and optimised the proposed system by incorporating user feedback, ensuring that it effectively meets the needs and preferences of its target users. The proposed course recommendation system could be a useful tool for students, instructors, and career advisers to use in promoting lifelong learning and professional progression as it fills the gap between university learning and industry expectations. We hope that the proposed course recommendation system will help university students in making data-drive and industry-informed course decisions, in turn, improving graduate outcomes for the university sector.

Abstract: The course forums are increasingly significant and play vital role in facilitating student discussions and answering their questions related to the course. It provides a platform for students to post their questions related to the content and admin issues related to the course. However, there are several challenges due to the increase in the number of students enrolled in the course. The primary challenge is that students' queries cannot be responded immediately and the instructors have to face lots of repetitive questions. To mitigate these issues, we propose a question answering system based on large language model with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) method. This work focuses on designing a question answering system with open source Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning it on the relevant course dataset. To further improve the performance, we use a local knowledge base and applied RAG method to retrieve relevant documents relevant to students' queries, where the local knowledge base contains all the course content. To mitigate the hallucination of LLMs, We also integrate it with multi chain-of-thought reasoning to overcome the challenge of hallucination in LLMs. In this work, we experiment fine-tuned LLM with RAG method on the HotpotQA dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned LLM with RAG method has a strong performance on question answering task.

Motivation: 大语言模型在文本生成任务中表现优异，但其嵌入空间存在各向同性问题，导致在专业领域（如法律和金融）的术语级表示能力不足，影响下游任务性能。

Method: 提出TermGPT框架：1）构建句子图捕捉语义和结构关系；2）基于上下文和拓扑线索生成语义一致但具有区分性的正负样本；3）设计句子级和词元级的多级对比学习方法。

Result: 构建了首个基于官方监管文件的金融术语数据集，实验表明TermGPT在金融和法律领域的术语区分任务中优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: TermGPT通过多级对比学习有效提升了LLM在专业领域术语表示的能力，为解决各向同性问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in text generation tasks; however, their embedding spaces often suffer from the isotropy problem, resulting in poor discrimination of domain-specific terminology, particularly in legal and financial contexts. This weakness in terminology-level representation can severely hinder downstream tasks such as legal judgment prediction or financial risk analysis, where subtle semantic distinctions are critical. To address this problem, we propose TermGPT, a multi-level contrastive fine-tuning framework designed for terminology adaptation. We first construct a sentence graph to capture semantic and structural relations, and generate semantically consistent yet discriminative positive and negative samples based on contextual and topological cues. We then devise a multi-level contrastive learning approach at both the sentence and token levels, enhancing global contextual understanding and fine-grained terminology discrimination. To support robust evaluation, we construct the first financial terminology dataset derived from official regulatory documents. Experiments show that TermGPT outperforms existing baselines in term discrimination tasks within the finance and legal domains.

TL;DR: InTRO是一个新的框架，通过令牌级探索和自我反馈来解决大型语言模型在思维链推理训练中的挑战，避免了监督微调惩罚有效替代方案的问题，以及强化学习在信用分配和计算成本方面的困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练大型语言模型进行思维链推理面临重大挑战：监督微调使用单一"黄金"原理会损害泛化能力，因为它惩罚了同样有效的替代方案；而使用可验证奖励的强化学习则在信用分配和计算成本方面遇到困难。

Method: InTRO利用校正因子——通过生成策略与其答案条件对应策略之间的信息差异估计的令牌级重要性权重，来进行信息丰富的下一个令牌选择。这种方法允许模型在单次前向传递中执行令牌级探索并接收自我生成的反馈。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准测试中，InTRO始终优于其他基线方法，相对于基础模型将解决方案准确率提高了高达20%。其思维链也明显更简洁，减少了冗余。

Conclusion: InTRO能够实现跨领域迁移，成功适应超出数学领域的领域外推理任务，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) for chain-of-thought reasoning presents a significant challenge: supervised fine-tuning on a single "golden" rationale hurts generalization as it penalizes equally valid alternatives, whereas reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards struggles with credit assignment and prohibitive computational cost. To tackle these limitations, we introduce InTRO (In-Token Rationality Optimization), a new framework that enables both token-level exploration and self-feedback for accurate and concise reasoning. Instead of directly optimizing an intractable objective over all valid reasoning paths, InTRO leverages correction factors-token-wise importance weights estimated by the information discrepancy between the generative policy and its answer-conditioned counterpart, for informative next token selection. This approach allows the model to perform token-level exploration and receive self-generated feedback within a single forward pass, ultimately encouraging accurate and concise rationales. Across six math-reasoning benchmarks, InTRO consistently outperforms other baselines, raising solution accuracy by up to 20% relative to the base model. Its chains of thought are also notably more concise, exhibiting reduced verbosity. Beyond this, InTRO enables cross-domain transfer, successfully adapting to out-of-domain reasoning tasks that extend beyond the realm of mathematics, demonstrating robust generalization.

Conclusion: EnchTable能够在不显著增加开销的情况下，无缝集成到各种部署流程中，实现跨任务领域和模型架构的通用适用性。

Abstract: Many machine learning models are fine-tuned from large language models (LLMs) to achieve high performance in specialized domains like code generation, biomedical analysis, and mathematical problem solving. However, this fine-tuning process often introduces a critical vulnerability: the systematic degradation of safety alignment, undermining ethical guidelines and increasing the risk of harmful outputs. Addressing this challenge, we introduce EnchTable, a novel framework designed to transfer and maintain safety alignment in downstream LLMs without requiring extensive retraining. EnchTable leverages a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based safety vector distillation method to decouple safety constraints from task-specific reasoning, ensuring compatibility across diverse model architectures and sizes. Additionally, our interference-aware merging technique effectively balances safety and utility, minimizing performance compromises across various task domains. We implemented a fully functional prototype of EnchTable on three different task domains and three distinct LLM architectures, and evaluated its performance through extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets, assessing both utility and model safety. Our evaluations include LLMs from different vendors, demonstrating EnchTable's generalization capability. Furthermore, EnchTable exhibits robust resistance to static and dynamic jailbreaking attacks, outperforming vendor-released safety models in mitigating adversarial prompts. Comparative analyses with six parameter modification methods and two inference-time alignment baselines reveal that EnchTable achieves a significantly lower unsafe rate, higher utility score, and universal applicability across different task domains. Additionally, we validate EnchTable can be seamlessly integrated into various deployment pipelines without significant overhead.

Method: 构建全面的预处理流程（面部关键点检测、唇部区域隔离稳定、多模态样本质量评估），采用课程学习策略，结合SigLIP编码器和Unified 3D-Resampler高效编码高帧率唇部运动。

Result: 在专门构建的HI-Dialogue数据集上，HI-TransPA在字面准确性和语义保真度方面均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 本研究为将Omni-Models应用于辅助通信技术奠定了基础，提供了端到端建模框架和关键处理工具。

Abstract: To provide a unified and flexible solution for daily communication among hearing-impaired individuals, we introduce the Omni-Model paradigm into assistive technology and present HI-TransPA, an instruction-driven audio-visual personal assistant. The model fuses indistinct speech with high-frame-rate lip dynamics, enabling both translation and dialogue within a single multimodal framework. To tackle the challenges of noisy and heterogeneous raw data and the limited adaptability of existing Omni-Models to hearing-impaired speech, we construct a comprehensive preprocessing and curation pipeline that detects facial landmarks, isolates and stabilizes the lip region, and quantitatively assesses multimodal sample quality. These quality scores guide a curriculum learning strategy that first trains on clean, high-confidence samples and progressively incorporates harder cases to strengthen model robustness. We further adopt a SigLIP encoder combined with a Unified 3D-Resampler to efficiently encode high-frame-rate lip motion. Experiments on our purpose-built HI-Dialogue dataset show that HI-TransPA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both literal accuracy and semantic fidelity. This work establishes a foundation for applying Omni-Models to assistive communication technology, providing an end-to-end modeling framework and essential processing tools for future research.

TL;DR: Norm-RAG是一个检索增强的智能框架，用于多轮对话中的社会规范推理，通过语义分块方法检索结构化规范文档，实现可解释的规范遵守和违反分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会规范是主观、语境依赖且跨文化变化的，现有方法主要针对孤立话语或合成对话，难以捕捉真实对话的流动性。

Method: 提出Norm-RAG框架，建模话语级属性（交流意图、说话者角色、人际关系框架、语言线索），通过语义分块检索结构化规范文档，并创建MINDS双语数据集。

Result: 实验表明Norm-RAG提高了规范检测和泛化能力，在文化适应性和社交智能对话系统方面表现更好。

Conclusion: Norm-RAG能够实现可解释、上下文感知的社会规范推理，为跨文化对话系统提供改进方案。

Abstract: Social norms are implicit, culturally grounded expectations that guide interpersonal communication. Unlike factual commonsense, norm reasoning is subjective, context-dependent, and varies across cultures, posing challenges for computational models. Prior works provide valuable normative annotations but mostly target isolated utterances or synthetic dialogues, limiting their ability to capture the fluid, multi-turn nature of real-world conversations. In this work, we present Norm-RAG, a retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for nuanced social norm inference in multi-turn dialogues. Norm-RAG models utterance-level attributes including communicative intent, speaker roles, interpersonal framing, and linguistic cues and grounds them in structured normative documentation retrieved via a novel Semantic Chunking approach. This enables interpretable and context-aware reasoning about norm adherence and violation across multilingual dialogues. We further introduce MINDS (Multilingual Interactions with Norm-Driven Speech), a bilingual dataset comprising 31 multi-turn Mandarin-English and Spanish-English conversations. Each turn is annotated for norm category and adherence status using multi-annotator consensus, reflecting cross-cultural and realistic norm expression. Our experiments show that Norm-RAG improves norm detection and generalization, demonstrates improved performance for culturally adaptive and socially intelligent dialogue systems.

*Canwen Wang,Jionghao Lin,Kenneth R. Koedinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究使用GPT-4o-mini在646个选择题数据集上扩展了"模拟教科书"LLM提示策略，发现自动生成的KC模型性能较差且冗余。通过提出基于余弦相似度的语义合并方法，显著改善了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识组件(KCs)是自适应学习系统的基础，但手动识别是一个瓶颈。虽然LLMs有望自动化此过程，但先前研究仅限于小数据集且产生冗余KC标签。

Method: 首先扩展"模拟教科书"LLM提示策略到646个问题数据集，然后提出基于余弦相似度的语义相似KC标签合并方法，评估不同相似度阈值的效果。

Result: 初始自动方法性能显著差于专家设计模型(RMSE 0.4285 vs 0.4206)，生成过多KCs(569 vs 101)。使用余弦相似度阈值0.8的合并策略将KC数量减少到428，RMSE改善到0.4259。

Conclusion: 虽然扩展的LLM生成本身不足够，但结合语义合并技术为自动化和精炼KC识别提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Knowledge Components (KCs) are foundational to adaptive learning systems, but their manual identification by domain experts is a significant bottleneck. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for automating this process, prior research has been limited to small datasets and has been shown to produce superfluous, redundant KC labels. This study addresses these limitations by first scaling a "simulated textbook" LLM prompting strategy (using GPT-4o-mini) to a larger dataset of 646 multiple-choice questions. We found that this initial automated approach performed significantly worse than an expert-designed KC model (RMSE 0.4285 vs. 0.4206) and generated an excessive number of KCs (569 vs. 101). To address the issue of redundancy, we proposed and evaluated a novel method for merging semantically similar KC labels based on their cosine similarity. This merging strategy significantly improved the model's performance; a model using a cosine similarity threshold of 0.8 achieved the best result, reducing the KC count to 428 and improving the RMSE to 0.4259. This demonstrates that while scaled LLM generation alone is insufficient, combining it with a semantic merging technique offers a viable path toward automating and refining KC identification.

TL;DR: 本文提出了REAP方法，通过递归评估和自适应规划来解决多跳推理任务中的全局规划不足问题，显著提升了推理的准确性和可追溯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成方法在多跳推理任务中缺乏全局规划，容易陷入局部推理困境，且对检索内容的利用不足，忽视了潜在线索，导致推理结果准确性无法保证。

Method: 提出REAP方法，包含子任务规划器(SP)和事实提取器(FE)两个核心模块。SP维护全局视角，指导整体推理方向并评估任务状态；FE对检索内容进行细粒度分析，提取可靠答案和线索。两模块协同工作，增量式构建逻辑一致的全局知识表示。

Result: 在多个公开多跳数据集上的实验表明，REAP方法在领域内和领域外设置下均显著优于现有RAG方法。

Conclusion: REAP方法通过结构化子任务和事实维护、动态优化推理轨迹，有效提升了复杂多跳推理任务的可靠性和可追溯性，统一任务范式设计也增强了在数据稀缺复杂任务上的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been extensively employed to mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods for multi-hop reasoning tasks often lack global planning, increasing the risk of falling into local reasoning impasses. Insufficient exploitation of retrieved content and the neglect of latent clues fail to ensure the accuracy of reasoning outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Recursive Evaluation and Adaptive Planning (REAP), whose core idea is to explicitly maintain structured sub-tasks and facts related to the current task through the Sub-task Planner (SP) and Fact Extractor (FE) modules. SP maintains a global perspective, guiding the overall reasoning direction and evaluating the task state based on the outcomes of FE, enabling dynamic optimization of the task-solving trajectory. FE performs fine-grained analysis over retrieved content to extract reliable answers and clues. These two modules incrementally enrich a logically coherent representation of global knowledge, enhancing the reliability and the traceability of the reasoning process. Furthermore, we propose a unified task paradigm design that enables effective multi-task fine-tuning, significantly enhancing SP's performance on complex, data-scarce tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple public multi-hop datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing RAG methods in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, validating its effectiveness in complex multi-hop reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在知识密集型任务中表现优异，但在数值推理方面存在困难，需要系统评估其在数值声明验证中的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用受控扰动（包括标签翻转探针）对最先进模型进行系统评估，测试其在数值声明和证据对上的真实性预测能力。

Result: 所有领先的专有系统在特定扰动下准确率下降高达62%，没有模型在所有条件下都表现鲁棒。增加上下文长度通常降低准确性，但通过扰动演示可以显著恢复性能。

Conclusion: 数值事实核查存在关键局限性，当前语言模型的鲁棒性仍然是一个开放挑战。

Abstract: Large language models show strong performance on knowledge intensive tasks such as fact-checking and question answering, yet they often struggle with numerical reasoning. We present a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models for veracity prediction on numerical claims and evidence pairs using controlled perturbations, including label-flipping probes, to test robustness. Our results indicate that even leading proprietary systems experience accuracy drops of up to 62\% under certain perturbations. No model proves to be robust across all conditions. We further find that increasing context length generally reduces accuracy, but when extended context is enriched with perturbed demonstrations, most models substantially recover. These findings highlight critical limitations in numerical fact-checking and suggest that robustness remains an open challenge for current language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为熵趋势约束（ETC）的训练无关方法，通过建模token级不确定性的动态变化来确定最佳检索时机，在动态检索增强生成中实现更早更精确的检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态检索增强生成允许LLMs按需获取外部知识，但现有方法基于低token级置信度触发检索，可能导致错误传播后才进行干预。

Method: ETC利用熵序列的一阶和二阶差分来检测新兴的不确定性趋势，从而确定最佳检索时机。该方法无需训练、即插即用且模型无关。

Result: 在六个QA基准测试和三个LLM骨干上的实验表明，ETC持续优于强基线方法，同时减少检索频率，在领域特定场景中尤其有效。

Conclusion: 趋势感知的不确定性建模能够产生更有效的检索时机，ETC方法具有鲁棒的泛化能力，可轻松集成到现有解码流水线中。

Abstract: Dynamic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows large language models (LLMs) to fetch external knowledge on demand, offering greater adaptability than static RAG. A central challenge in this setting lies in determining the optimal timing for retrieval. Existing methods often trigger retrieval based on low token-level confidence, which may lead to delayed intervention after errors have already propagated. We introduce Entropy-Trend Constraint (ETC), a training-free method that determines optimal retrieval timing by modeling the dynamics of token-level uncertainty. Specifically, ETC utilizes first- and second-order differences of the entropy sequence to detect emerging uncertainty trends, enabling earlier and more precise retrieval. Experiments on six QA benchmarks with three LLM backbones demonstrate that ETC consistently outperforms strong baselines while reducing retrieval frequency. ETC is particularly effective in domain-specific scenarios, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities. Ablation studies and qualitative analyses further confirm that trend-aware uncertainty modeling yields more effective retrieval timing. The method is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and readily integrable into existing decoding pipelines. Implementation code is included in the supplementary materials.

Method: 提出Soft Constrained Decoding方法，通过惩罚非目标语言token来温和地引导生成朝向目标语言，该方法与模型无关，无需修改架构或额外数据。

Conclusion: SCD是一种轻量级、训练无关的解码策略，能有效缓解多语言RAG中的语言漂移问题，提高跨语言生成的质量和稳定性。

Abstract: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform knowledge-intensive tasks in multilingual settings by leveraging retrieved documents as external evidence. However, when the retrieved evidence differs in language from the user query and in-context exemplars, the model often exhibits language drift by generating responses in an unintended language. This phenomenon is especially pronounced during reasoning-intensive decoding, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation, where intermediate steps introduce further language instability. In this paper, we systematically study output language drift in multilingual RAG across multiple datasets, languages, and LLM backbones. Our controlled experiments reveal that the drift results not from comprehension failure but from decoder-level collapse, where dominant token distributions and high-frequency English patterns dominate the intended generation language. We further observe that English serves as a semantic attractor under cross-lingual conditions, emerging as both the strongest interference source and the most frequent fallback language.
  To mitigate this, we propose Soft Constrained Decoding (SCD), a lightweight, training-free decoding strategy that gently steers generation toward the target language by penalizing non-target-language tokens. SCD is model-agnostic and can be applied to any generation algorithm without modifying the architecture or requiring additional data. Experiments across three multilingual datasets and multiple typologically diverse languages show that SCD consistently improves language alignment and task performance, providing an effective and generalizable solution in multilingual RAG.

TL;DR: BERTScore在金融领域存在数值变化敏感性不足的问题，FinNuE诊断数据集揭示了这一局限性，推动需要数值感知的金融NLP评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现BERTScore在金融文本中对数值变化的敏感性不足，而金融领域中数值精度直接影响语义（如区分2%收益与20%损失），这构成了重要的评估缺陷。

Method: 构建FinNuE诊断数据集，通过在不同金融文本类型（财报电话会议、监管文件、社交媒体、新闻文章）中引入受控的数值扰动来测试BERTScore的性能。

Result: BERTScore无法区分语义上关键的数值差异，经常为财务上截然不同的文本对分配高相似度分数，暴露了基于嵌入的度量方法在金融领域的根本局限性。

Conclusion: 基于嵌入的度量方法在金融NLP中存在根本局限性，需要开发数值感知的评估框架来解决BERTScore在金融文本评估中的不足。

Abstract: BERTScore has become a widely adopted metric for evaluating semantic similarity between natural language sentences. However, we identify a critical limitation: BERTScore exhibits low sensitivity to numerical variation, a significant weakness in finance where numerical precision directly affects meaning (e.g., distinguishing a 2% gain from a 20% loss). We introduce FinNuE, a diagnostic dataset constructed with controlled numerical perturbations across earnings calls, regulatory filings, social media, and news articles. Using FinNuE, demonstrate that BERTScore fails to distinguish semantically critical numerical differences, often assigning high similarity scores to financially divergent text pairs. Our findings reveal fundamental limitations of embedding-based metrics for finance and motivate numerically-aware evaluation frameworks for financial NLP.

Conclusion: 该研究为LLMs在正式教育系统中的有效应用提供了框架和评估方法，分析了现有模型的适用性和局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like content. This has revolutionized various sectors such as healthcare, software development, and education. In education, LLMs offer potential for personalized and interactive learning experiences, especially in regions with limited teaching resources. However, adapting these models effectively to curriculum-specific content, such as the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) syllabus in India, presents unique challenges in terms of accuracy, alignment, and pedagogical relevance. In this paper, we present the framework "PustakAI"\footnote{Pustak means `book' in many Indian languages.} for the design and evaluation of a novel question-answering dataset "NCERT-QA" aligned with the NCERT curriculum for English and Science subjects of grades 6 to 8. We classify the curated QA pairs as Factoid, Inferential, and Others (evaluative and reasoning). We evaluate the dataset with various prompting techniques, such as meta-prompt, few-shot, and CoT-style prompting, using diverse evaluation metrics to understand which approach aligns more efficiently with the structure and demands of the curriculum. Along with the usability of the dataset, we analyze the strengths and limitations of current open-source LLMs (Gemma3:1b, Llama3.2:3b, and Nemotron-mini:4b) and high-end LLMs (Llama-4-Scout-17B and Deepseek-r1-70B) as AI-based learning tools in formal education systems.

Motivation: 标准自注意力的二次复杂度严重限制了Transformer模型在长上下文任务中的应用，而现有的高效Transformer变体通常需要架构修改和昂贵的从头预训练。

Method: 将长输入分段为重叠块，为解码器生成压缩的上下文感知表示。核心是一种新颖的无参数融合机制，通过用所有前后块的累积上下文向量丰富每个块的边界表示，使每个块的表示具有其在文档中位置的结构意识。

Conclusion: ScaleFormer提供了一种简单有效的方法，使预训练模型能够有效推理长文本，为文档叙事流提供强信号，实现线性复杂度。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of standard self-attention severely limits the application of Transformer-based models to long-context tasks. While efficient Transformer variants exist, they often require architectural changes and costly pre-training from scratch. To circumvent this, we propose ScaleFormer(Span Representation Cumulation for Long-Context Transformer) - a simple and effective plug-and-play framework that adapts off-the-shelf pre-trained encoder-decoder models to process long sequences without requiring architectural modifications. Our approach segments long inputs into overlapping chunks and generates a compressed, context-aware representation for the decoder. The core of our method is a novel, parameter-free fusion mechanism that endows each chunk's representation with structural awareness of its position within the document. It achieves this by enriching each chunk's boundary representations with cumulative context vectors from all preceding and succeeding chunks. This strategy provides the model with a strong signal of the document's narrative flow, achieves linear complexity, and enables pre-trained models to reason effectively over long-form text. Experiments on long-document summarization show that our method is highly competitive with and often outperforms state-of-the-art approaches without requiring architectural modifications or external retrieval mechanisms.

Conclusion: 该研究首次提供了MLLMs可解释性方面语音象征性的大规模定量分析，为人工智能与认知语言学的交叉研究搭建了桥梁。

Abstract: Sound symbolism is a linguistic concept that refers to non-arbitrary associations between phonetic forms and their meanings. We suggest that this can be a compelling probe into how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) interpret auditory information in human languages. We investigate MLLMs' performance on phonetic iconicity across textual (orthographic and IPA) and auditory forms of inputs with up to 25 semantic dimensions (e.g., sharp vs. round), observing models' layer-wise information processing by measuring phoneme-level attention fraction scores. To this end, we present LEX-ICON, an extensive mimetic word dataset consisting of 8,052 words from four natural languages (English, French, Japanese, and Korean) and 2,930 systematically constructed pseudo-words, annotated with semantic features applied across both text and audio modalities. Our key findings demonstrate (1) MLLMs' phonetic intuitions that align with existing linguistic research across multiple semantic dimensions and (2) phonosemantic attention patterns that highlight models' focus on iconic phonemes. These results bridge domains of artificial intelligence and cognitive linguistics, providing the first large-scale, quantitative analyses of phonetic iconicity in terms of MLLMs' interpretability.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖大规模多轮对话数据集微调大语言模型，将每个响应生成视为独立任务，未能显式将多轮指令跟随纳入优化目标，导致模型难以处理复杂的长期约束。

Method: GraphIF包含三个关键组件：基于智能体的关系提取模块构建结构化图、关系图提示生成模块将图信息转换为自然语言提示、响应重写模块使用图提示优化初始LLM输出。

Result: 在两个长多轮对话数据集上的广泛实验表明，GraphIF可以无缝集成到指令微调的LLMs中，在所有四个多轮指令跟随评估指标上均带来显著改进。

Conclusion: 图结构特别适合建模多轮指令跟随，GraphIF框架通过将多轮对话建模为有向关系图并利用图提示，有效增强了LLMs的多轮指令跟随能力。

Abstract: Multi-turn instruction following is essential for building intelligent conversational systems that can consistently adhere to instructions across dialogue turns. However, existing approaches to enhancing multi-turn instruction following primarily rely on collecting or generating large-scale multi-turn dialogue datasets to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), which treat each response generation as an isolated task and fail to explicitly incorporate multi-turn instruction following into the optimization objectives. As a result, instruction-tuned LLMs often struggle with complex long-distance constraints. In multi-turn dialogues, relational constraints across turns can be naturally modeled as labeled directed edges, making graph structures particularly suitable for modeling multi-turn instruction following. Despite this potential, leveraging graph structures to enhance the multi-turn instruction following capabilities of LLMs remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose GraphIF, a plug-and-play framework that models multi-turn dialogues as directed relation graphs and leverages graph prompts to enhance the instruction following capabilities of LLMs. GraphIF comprises three key components: (1) an agent-based relation extraction module that captures inter-turn semantic relations via action-triggered mechanisms to construct structured graphs; (2) a relation graph prompt generation module that converts structured graph information into natural language prompts; and (3) a response rewriting module that refines initial LLM outputs using the generated graph prompts. Extensive experiments on two long multi-turn dialogue datasets demonstrate that GraphIF can be seamlessly integrated into instruction-tuned LLMs and leads to significant improvements across all four multi-turn instruction-following evaluation metrics.

Abstract: We present ADI-20, an extension of the previously published ADI-17 Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI) dataset. ADI-20 covers all Arabic-speaking countries' dialects. It comprises 3,556 hours from 19 Arabic dialects in addition to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). We used this dataset to train and evaluate various state-of-the-art ADI systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着科学论文提交数量的增加，需要能够协助评审人员评估研究声明的系统。实验结果通常以表格或图表形式呈现，但当前多模态LLM在不同证据格式下验证科学声明的鲁棒性仍是一个重要且未被充分探索的挑战。

Method: 设计并实施了一系列实验，评估多模态LLM使用表格和图表作为证据验证科学声明的能力。为此，调整了两个现有科学论文数据集，加入多模态声明验证任务所需的注释和结构。使用这个调整后的数据集评估了12个多模态LLM。

Result: 当前模型在处理基于表格的证据时表现更好，而在处理基于图表的证据时表现较差。人类评估显示人类在两种格式下都保持强劲表现，与模型形成对比。分析还发现，较小的多模态LLM（8B以下）在基于表格和基于图表的任务中表现相关性较弱，表明跨模态泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了当前模型在多模态推理能力方面存在关键差距。建议未来的多模态LLM应更加重视改进图表理解能力，以更好地支持科学声明验证。

Abstract: With the growing number of submitted scientific papers, there is an increasing demand for systems that can assist reviewers in evaluating research claims. Experimental results are a core component of scientific work, often presented in varying formats such as tables or charts. Understanding how robust current multimodal large language models (multimodal LLMs) are at verifying scientific claims across different evidence formats remains an important and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we design and conduct a series of experiments to assess the ability of multimodal LLMs to verify scientific claims using both tables and charts as evidence. To enable this evaluation, we adapt two existing datasets of scientific papers by incorporating annotations and structures necessary for a multimodal claim verification task. Using this adapted dataset, we evaluate 12 multimodal LLMs and find that current models perform better with table-based evidence while struggling with chart-based evidence. We further conduct human evaluations and observe that humans maintain strong performance across both formats, unlike the models. Our analysis also reveals that smaller multimodal LLMs (under 8B) show weak correlation in performance between table-based and chart-based tasks, indicating limited cross-modal generalization. These findings highlight a critical gap in current models' multimodal reasoning capabilities. We suggest that future multimodal LLMs should place greater emphasis on improving chart understanding to better support scientific claim verification.

Motivation: 社交媒体已成为监测灾难事件的重要工具，但现有系统存在事件相关偏差问题，影响其对新事件的泛化能力。

Method: 采用因果学习视角，提出减少事件和领域相关偏差的方法。

Result: 在三个灾难分类任务中，该方法比多个基线方法F1分数提升高达+1.9%，并显著改善了基于预训练语言模型的分类器性能。

Conclusion: 通过因果视角的偏差缓解方法能有效提高灾难事件分类系统的泛化能力。

Abstract: Due to the rapid growth of social media platforms, these tools have become essential for monitoring information during ongoing disaster events. However, extracting valuable insights requires real-time processing of vast amounts of data. A major challenge in existing systems is their exposure to event-related biases, which negatively affects their ability to generalize to emerging events. While recent advancements in debiasing and causal learning offer promising solutions, they remain underexplored in the disaster event domain. In this work, we approach bias mitigation through a causal lens and propose a method to reduce event- and domain-related biases, enhancing generalization to future events. Our approach outperforms multiple baselines by up to +1.9% F1 and significantly improves a PLM-based classifier across three disaster classification tasks.

TL;DR: VISTA是一个基于Web的可视化交互系统，用于分析多轮推理任务中大型语言模型的推理过程，通过可视化上下文影响和生成推理依赖树来降低分析复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏专门的可视化工具来分析多轮交互中LLMs的复杂推理过程，导致研究人员认知负荷高，难以理解模型的推理能力。

Method: 开发VISTA平台，提供上下文影响可视化、交互式对话历史修改以进行假设分析，以及自动生成推理依赖树的功能。

Result: VISTA显著降低了分析推理链的复杂性，提供了对LLMs能力和局限性的更深入理解。

Conclusion: VISTA作为一个开源平台，支持自定义基准和本地模型集成，为多轮推理分析提供了统一的交互框架。

Abstract: Recent research has increasingly focused on the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-turn interactions, as these scenarios more closely mirror real-world problem-solving. However, analyzing the intricate reasoning processes within these interactions presents a significant challenge due to complex contextual dependencies and a lack of specialized visualization tools, leading to a high cognitive load for researchers. To address this gap, we present VISTA, an web-based Visual Interactive System for Textual Analytics in multi-turn reasoning tasks. VISTA allows users to visualize the influence of context on model decisions and interactively modify conversation histories to conduct "what-if" analyses across different models. Furthermore, the platform can automatically parse a session and generate a reasoning dependency tree, offering a transparent view of the model's step-by-step logical path. By providing a unified and interactive framework, VISTA significantly reduces the complexity of analyzing reasoning chains, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of the capabilities and limitations of current LLMs. The platform is open-source and supports easy integration of custom benchmarks and local models.

TL;DR: Text2SQL-Flow是一个SQL感知的数据增强框架，通过六个维度生成大规模、语义有效且结构多样的Text-to-SQL对，构建了包含89,544个标注示例的高质量SQLFlow数据集，显著提升了开源和闭源LLM在Text-to-SQL任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Text-to-SQL领域因数据稀缺、简单和低多样性而导致的性能瓶颈问题，建立可扩展的数据中心化基础。

Method: 提出Text2SQL-Flow框架，包含六个数据增强维度、端到端流水线（SQL执行验证、自然语言问题生成、思维链推理轨迹、数据分类）和模块化数据库管理器，并引入掩码对齐检索方法用于闭源LLM。

Result: 构建了89,544个标注示例的SQLFlow数据集；在相同数据预算下，开源LLM微调后性能持续提升；闭源LLM的检索策略优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 建立了可扩展的数据中心化基础，突显了高质量结构化数据在现代AI中的关键作用，为推进Text-to-SQL系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The data-centric paradigm has become pivotal in AI, especially for Text-to-SQL, where performance is limited by scarce, simplistic, and low-diversity datasets. To address this, we propose Text2SQL-Flow, a SQL-aware data augmentation framework that generates large-scale, semantically valid, and structurally diverse Text-to-SQL pairs from minimal seed data. It operates across six augmentation dimensions and integrates an end-to-end pipeline featuring SQL execution verification, natural language question generation, chain-of-thought reasoning traces, and data classification. A modular Database Manager ensures cross-database compatibility and scalability. Using this framework, we build SQLFlow, a high-quality dataset of 89,544 annotated examples. We evaluate SQLFlow in two settings: (1) For open-source LLMs, fine-tuning on SQLFlow consistently improves performance across benchmarks under the same data budget. (2) For closed-source LLMs, we introduce a masked alignment retrieval method that treats SQLFlow as both knowledge base and training data for the retriever. This enables structure-aware example matching by modeling fine-grained alignments between questions and SQL queries. Experiments show our retrieval strategy outperforms existing methods, underscoring the value of SQLFlow's high-fidelity data and our novel technique. Our work establishes a scalable, data-centric foundation for advancing Text-to-SQL systems and highlights the critical role of high-quality structured data in modern AI.

TL;DR: EffiReason-Bench是一个用于评估高效推理方法的统一基准，通过构建标准化的推理结构注释和提出E3-Score评估指标，对7种方法在6个开源LLM上进行跨范式评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型使用思维链提示虽然推理能力强，但往往产生不必要的冗长解释，增加了成本有时还降低了准确性。现有效率导向方法的公平比较受到碎片化评估实践的阻碍。

Method: 引入EffiReason-Bench基准，构建经过验证的思维链注释，提出E3-Score评估指标，在数学、常识和逻辑三个领域的4个数据集上评估7种方法在6个开源LLM上的表现。

Result: 实验表明没有单一方法在所有情况下都占优，最优策略取决于骨干模型规模、任务复杂度和架构。

Conclusion: 需要根据具体场景选择高效推理方法，EffiReason-Bench为跨范式评估提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting achieve strong reasoning but often produce unnecessarily long explanations, increasing cost and sometimes reducing accuracy. Fair comparison of efficiency-oriented approaches is hindered by fragmented evaluation practices. We introduce EffiReason-Bench, a unified benchmark for rigorous cross-paradigm evaluation of efficient reasoning methods across three categories: Reasoning Blueprints, Dynamic Execution, and Post-hoc Refinement. To enable step-by-step evaluation, we construct verified CoT annotations for CommonsenseQA and LogiQA via a pipeline that enforces standardized reasoning structures, comprehensive option-wise analysis, and human verification. We evaluate 7 methods across 6 open-source LLMs (1B-70B) on 4 datasets spanning mathematics, commonsense, and logic, and propose the E3-Score, a principled metric inspired by economic trade-off modeling that provides smooth, stable evaluation without discontinuities or heavy reliance on heuristics. Experiments show that no single method universally dominates; optimal strategies depend on backbone scale, task complexity, and architecture.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的人物感知对齐框架（PAL），通过两阶段训练方法直接以人物对齐作为对话生成训练目标，解决了现有方法容易忽视给定人物信息生成通用回复的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流个性化对话生成模型通常依赖基于人物对话数据的token级语言模型训练来隐式实现个性化，这些方法往往忽视给定的人物信息并生成通用回复。

Method: 采用两阶段训练方法：人物感知学习和人物对齐，配备易于使用的推理策略"选择然后生成"，在语义层面提高人物敏感性并生成更相关的人物回复。

Result: 通过大量实验证明，该框架优于许多最先进的个性化对话方法和大型语言模型。

Conclusion: PAL框架通过直接以人物对齐为训练目标，有效提升了对话生成中的人物相关性和一致性。

Abstract: Personalized dialogue generation aims to leverage persona profiles and dialogue history to generate persona-relevant and consistent responses. Mainstream models typically rely on token-level language model training with persona dialogue data, such as Next Token Prediction, to implicitly achieve personalization, making these methods tend to neglect the given personas and generate generic responses. To address this issue, we propose a novel Persona-Aware Alignment Framework (PAL), which directly treats persona alignment as the training objective of dialogue generation. Specifically, PAL employs a two-stage training method including Persona-aware Learning and Persona Alignment, equipped with an easy-to-use inference strategy Select then Generate, to improve persona sensitivity and generate more persona-relevant responses at the semantics level. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework outperforms many state-of-the-art personalized dialogue methods and large language models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常忽略多语言数据的内在语言结构，导致多语言能力对训练数据组成高度敏感。

Method: 两阶段预选框架：首先基于语言可分性分数过滤数据，然后用现有方法精炼子集。语言可分性量化不同语言样本在模型表示空间中的可区分程度。

Result: 在6个基准测试和22种语言上的实验表明，LangGPS能提高现有选择方法的有效性和泛化能力，特别是在理解任务和低资源语言上。

Conclusion: 语言可分性为多语言环境下的数据效用提供了新视角，支持开发更具语言意识的LLMs，并可作为多语言课程学习的有效信号。

Abstract: Joint multilingual instruction tuning is a widely adopted approach to improve the multilingual instruction-following ability and downstream performance of large language models (LLMs), but the resulting multilingual capability remains highly sensitive to the composition and selection of the training data. Existing selection methods, often based on features like text quality, diversity, or task relevance, typically overlook the intrinsic linguistic structure of multilingual data. In this paper, we propose LangGPS, a lightweight two-stage pre-selection framework guided by language separability which quantifies how well samples in different languages can be distinguished in the model's representation space. LangGPS first filters training data based on separability scores and then refines the subset using existing selection methods. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks and 22 languages demonstrate that applying LangGPS on top of existing selection methods improves their effectiveness and generalizability in multilingual training, especially for understanding tasks and low-resource languages. Further analysis reveals that highly separable samples facilitate the formation of clearer language boundaries and support faster adaptation, while low-separability samples tend to function as bridges for cross-lingual alignment. Besides, we also find that language separability can serve as an effective signal for multilingual curriculum learning, where interleaving samples with diverse separability levels yields stable and generalizable gains. Together, we hope our work offers a new perspective on data utility in multilingual contexts and support the development of more linguistically informed LLMs.

Motivation: 当前端到端语音语言模型存在显著响应延迟，主要源于语音令牌的自回归生成和复杂流匹配模型的使用。

Method: 提出VocalNet-M2模型，集成多码本分词器和多令牌预测策略，直接生成多码本语音令牌，无需流匹配模型。

Result: 实验显示VocalNet-M2大幅降低首块延迟（约725ms到350ms），同时在主流语音语言模型中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发实时交互应用的高效高性能语音语言模型提供了宝贵见解，并全面比较了单码本和多码本策略。

Abstract: Current end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have made notable progress, yet they still encounter considerable response latency. This delay primarily arises from the autoregressive generation of speech tokens and the reliance on complex flow-matching models for speech synthesis. To overcome this, we introduce VocalNet-M2, a novel low-latency SLM that integrates a multi-codebook tokenizer and a multi-token prediction (MTP) strategy. Our model directly generates multi-codebook speech tokens, thus eliminating the need for a latency-inducing flow-matching model. Furthermore, our MTP strategy enhances generation efficiency and improves overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VocalNet-M2 achieves a substantial reduction in first chunk latency (from approximately 725ms to 350ms) while maintaining competitive performance across mainstream SLMs. This work also provides a comprehensive comparison of single-codebook and multi-codebook strategies, offering valuable insights for developing efficient and high-performance SLMs for real-time interactive applications.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注单轮交互和对话特征，忽略了多轮通信的复杂性以及指令遵循和安全性等关键能力，且在多轮设置中评估全双工语音语言模型面临挑战。

Method: 通过将连续的全双工对话分割为离散轮次，构建MTR-DuplexBench基准，支持在对话质量、对话动态、指令遵循和安全性等方面进行逐轮评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，当前的全双工语音语言模型在多个轮次和评估维度上难以保持一致的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的基准对于评估全双工语音语言模型在多轮对话中的性能是必要且有效的，基准和代码将在未来发布。

Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) enable real-time, overlapping conversational interactions, offering a more dynamic user experience compared to traditional half-duplex models. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating single-round interactions and conversational features, neglecting the complexities of multi-round communication and critical capabilities such as instruction following and safety. Evaluating FD-SLMs in multi-round settings poses significant challenges, including blurred turn boundaries in communication and context inconsistency during model inference. To address these gaps, we introduce MTR-DuplexBench, a novel benchmark that segments continuous full-duplex dialogues into discrete turns, enabling comprehensive, turn-by-turn evaluation of FD-SLMs across dialogue quality, conversational dynamics, instruction following, and safety. Experimental results reveal that current FD-SLMs face difficulties in maintaining consistent performance across multiple rounds and evaluation dimensions, highlighting the necessity and effectiveness of our proposed benchmark. The benchmark and code will be available in the future.

Motivation: 解决组织在处理敏感文档时面临的困境：使用基于云的AI系统会损害数据隐私，而本地处理虽然安全但准确性差。

Method: 结合语义理解和关键词精度两种互补的检索策略，完全在本地基础设施上运行，无需互联网访问，利用消费级硬件加速。

Result: 在复杂查询（法律、科学和对话文档）上实现了竞争性准确率，同时保持所有数据在本地机器上，错误率极低。

Conclusion: 隐私和性能在企业AI部署中不必相互排斥，银行、医院和律师事务所等组织可以在不将专有信息传输给外部提供商的情况下采用对话式文档AI。

Abstract: Organizations handling sensitive documents face a critical dilemma: adopt cloud-based AI systems that offer powerful question-answering capabilities but compromise data privacy, or maintain local processing that ensures security but delivers poor accuracy. We present a question-answering system that resolves this trade-off by combining semantic understanding with keyword precision, operating entirely on local infrastructure without internet access. Our approach demonstrates that organizations can achieve competitive accuracy on complex queries across legal, scientific, and conversational documents while keeping all data on their machines. By balancing two complementary retrieval strategies and using consumer-grade hardware acceleration, the system delivers reliable answers with minimal errors, letting banks, hospitals, and law firms adopt conversational document AI without transmitting proprietary information to external providers. This work establishes that privacy and performance need not be mutually exclusive in enterprise AI deployment.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖高质量监督微调来增强批判能力，但很少深入探究LLMs批判性能差的根本原因——不平衡的评估偏好。

Method: 构建OPS基准量化LLMs评估行为差异，通过统计偏好分析发现LLMs倾向于将低困惑度解判断为正确；提出困惑度感知强化学习算法（Group Relative Policy Optimization）来纠正这种偏好。

Conclusion: 通过识别并纠正LLMs的不平衡评估偏好，可以有效提升其在多步数学推理中的批判能力。

Abstract: To improve Multi-step Mathematical Reasoning (MsMR) of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is crucial to obtain scalable supervision from the corpus by automatically critiquing mistakes in the reasoning process of MsMR and rendering a final verdict of the problem-solution. Most existing methods rely on crafting high-quality supervised fine-tuning demonstrations for critiquing capability enhancement and pay little attention to delving into the underlying reason for the poor critiquing performance of LLMs. In this paper, we orthogonally quantify and investigate the potential reason -- imbalanced evaluation preference, and conduct a statistical preference analysis. Motivated by the analysis of the reason, a novel perplexity-aware reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to rectify the evaluation preference, elevating the critiquing capability. Specifically, to probe into LLMs' critiquing characteristics, a One-to-many Problem-Solution (OPS) benchmark is meticulously constructed to quantify the behavior difference of LLMs when evaluating the problem solutions generated by itself and others. Then, to investigate the behavior difference in depth, we conduct a statistical preference analysis oriented on perplexity and find an intriguing phenomenon -- ``LLMs incline to judge solutions with lower perplexity as correct'', which is dubbed as \textit{imbalanced evaluation preference}. To rectify this preference, we regard perplexity as the baton in the algorithm of Group Relative Policy Optimization, supporting the LLMs to explore trajectories that judge lower perplexity as wrong and higher perplexity as correct. Extensive experimental results on our built OPS and existing available critic benchmarks demonstrate the validity of our method.

Abstract: In the context of pretraining of Large Language Models (LLMs), synthetic data has emerged as an alternative for generating high-quality pretraining data at scale. This is particularly beneficial in low-resource language settings where the benefits of recent LLMs have been unevenly distributed across languages. In this work, we present a systematic study on the generation and evaluation of synthetic multilingual pretraining data for Indic languages, where we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset BhashaKritika, comprising 540B tokens using 5 different techniques for 10 languages. We explore the impact of grounding generation in documents, personas, and topics. We analyze how language choice, both in the prompt instructions and document grounding, affects data quality, and we compare translations of English content with native generation in Indic languages. To support scalable and language-sensitive evaluation, we introduce a modular quality evaluation pipeline that integrates script and language detection, metadata consistency checks, n-gram repetition analysis, and perplexity-based filtering using KenLM models. Our framework enables robust quality control across diverse scripts and linguistic contexts. Empirical results through model runs reveal key trade-offs in generation strategies and highlight best practices for constructing effective multilingual corpora.

We validate the methodology through a case study on authenticity assessment debates. Methodology - ATR4CH combines annotation models, ontological frameworks, and LLM-based extraction through iterative development: foundational analysis, annotation schema development, pipeline architecture, integration refinement, and comprehensive evaluation. We demonstrate the approach using Wikipedia articles about disputed items (documents, artifacts...), implementing a sequential pipeline with three LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.7, Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o-mini). Findings - The methodology successfully extracts complex Cultural Heritage knowledge: 0.96-0.99 F1 for metadata extraction, 0.7-0.8 F1 for entity recognition, 0.65-0.75 F1 for hypothesis extraction, 0.95-0.97 for evidence extraction, and 0.62 G-EVAL for discourse representation. Smaller models performed competitively, enabling cost-effective deployment. Originality - This is the first systematic methodology for coordinating LLM-based extraction with Cultural Heritage ontologies. ATR4CH provides a replicable framework adaptable across CH domains and institutional resources. Research Limitations - The produced KG is limited to Wikipedia articles. While the results are encouraging, human oversight is necessary during post-processing. Practical Implications - ATR4CH enables Cultural Heritage institutions to systematically convert textual knowledge into queryable KGs, supporting automated metadata enrichment and knowledge discovery.

*Shuyi Liu,Yuming Shang,Xi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TruthfulRAG是一个基于知识图谱的RAG框架，通过构建知识图谱、图检索和基于熵的过滤机制来解决RAG系统中检索外部知识与LLM内部知识之间的冲突，提高生成内容的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统在解决知识冲突时通常在token或语义层面操作，导致对事实差异的理解碎片化，特别是在知识密集型任务中。随着外部知识库的扩展和模型参数知识过时，解决检索外部信息与LLM内部知识之间的冲突成为关键挑战。

Method: TruthfulRAG框架：1）从检索内容中系统提取三元组构建知识图谱；2）使用基于查询的图检索识别相关知识；3）采用基于熵的过滤机制精确定位冲突元素并缓解事实不一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明，TruthfulRAG优于现有方法，有效缓解知识冲突，提高了RAG系统的鲁棒性和可信度。

Conclusion: TruthfulRAG是首个利用知识图谱解决RAG系统中事实层面知识冲突的框架，能够使LLM生成更忠实和准确的响应。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework for enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval-based methods with generative models. As external knowledge repositories continue to expand and the parametric knowledge within models becomes outdated, a critical challenge for RAG systems is resolving conflicts between retrieved external information and LLMs' internal knowledge, which can significantly compromise the accuracy and reliability of generated content. However, existing approaches to conflict resolution typically operate at the token or semantic level, often leading to fragmented and partial understanding of factual discrepancies between LLMs' knowledge and context, particularly in knowledge-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we propose TruthfulRAG, the first framework that leverages Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to resolve factual-level knowledge conflicts in RAG systems. Specifically, TruthfulRAG constructs KGs by systematically extracting triples from retrieved content, utilizes query-based graph retrieval to identify relevant knowledge, and employs entropy-based filtering mechanisms to precisely locate conflicting elements and mitigate factual inconsistencies, thereby enabling LLMs to generate faithful and accurate responses. Extensive experiments reveal that TruthfulRAG outperforms existing methods, effectively alleviating knowledge conflicts and improving the robustness and trustworthiness of RAG systems.

*Jason Chan,Zhixue Zhao,Robert Gaizauskas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文认为评估基础大语言模型的推理能力存在方法论问题，因为基础LLM的预训练目标与推理评估的正确性标准存在根本性不匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究评估基础LLM的推理能力，但忽视了这些评估方法的内在问题。作者旨在揭示基础LLM预训练目标与推理评估标准之间的根本性不匹配。

Method: 通过理论分析，展示基础LLM生成逻辑有效或无效结论只是语言统计模式一致性的副产品，而非真正的推理尝试。

Result: 发现基础LLM的输出不能被视为其真实推理尝试，且关于基础LLM推理能力的结论不能推广到经过指令优化的后训练LLM。

Conclusion: 呼吁重新审视依赖这些假设的现有研究，并要求未来工作考虑这些方法论陷阱。

Abstract: Existing work investigates the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to uncover their limitations, human-like biases and underlying processes. Such studies include evaluations of base LLMs (pre-trained on unlabeled corpora only) for this purpose. Our position paper argues that evaluating base LLMs' reasoning capabilities raises inherent methodological concerns that are overlooked in such existing studies. We highlight the fundamental mismatch between base LLMs' pretraining objective and normative qualities, such as correctness, by which reasoning is assessed. In particular, we show how base LLMs generate logically valid or invalid conclusions as coincidental byproducts of conforming to purely linguistic patterns of statistical plausibility. This fundamental mismatch challenges the assumptions that (a) base LLMs' outputs can be assessed as their bona fide attempts at correct answers or conclusions; and (b) conclusions about base LLMs' reasoning can generalize to post-trained LLMs optimized for successful instruction-following. We call for a critical re-examination of existing work that relies implicitly on these assumptions, and for future work to account for these methodological pitfalls.

*Cristian Santini,Sebastian Barzaghi,Paolo Sernani,Emanuele Frontoni,Mehwish Alam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DELICATE是一种用于历史意大利语实体链接的神经符号方法，结合BERT编码器和Wikidata上下文信息，通过时间合理性和实体类型一致性选择知识库实体。ENEIDE是一个从19-20世纪文学和政治文本中半自动提取的多领域历史意大利语实体链接语料库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人文学科中实体链接面临的挑战：复杂文档类型、缺乏领域特定数据集和模型、长尾实体在知识库中代表性不足的问题。

Method: 提出DELICATE神经符号方法，将BERT编码器与Wikidata上下文信息结合，利用时间合理性和实体类型一致性进行实体选择。同时构建ENEIDE多领域历史意大利语实体链接语料库。

Result: DELICATE在历史意大利语实体链接任务中优于其他模型，即使与拥有数十亿参数的大型架构相比。其置信度分数和特征敏感性提供了比纯神经方法更可解释和可理解的结果。

Conclusion: DELICATE方法在历史意大利语实体链接任务中表现出色，提供了更好的可解释性，ENEIDE语料库为领域研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: In spite of the remarkable advancements in the field of Natural Language Processing, the task of Entity Linking (EL) remains challenging in the field of humanities due to complex document typologies, lack of domain-specific datasets and models, and long-tail entities, i.e., entities under-represented in Knowledge Bases (KBs). The goal of this paper is to address these issues with two main contributions. The first contribution is DELICATE, a novel neuro-symbolic method for EL on historical Italian which combines a BERT-based encoder with contextual information from Wikidata to select appropriate KB entities using temporal plausibility and entity type consistency. The second contribution is ENEIDE, a multi-domain EL corpus in historical Italian semi-automatically extracted from two annotated editions spanning from the 19th to the 20th century and including literary and political texts. Results show how DELICATE outperforms other EL models in historical Italian even if compared with larger architectures with billions of parameters. Moreover, further analyses reveal how DELICATE confidence scores and features sensitivity provide results which are more explainable and interpretable than purely neural methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于类比范式组织的计算方法，通过三个认知启发原则（类比结构、对比学习和最小上下文线索），使轻量级模型仅用少量数据就能达到与大型语言模型相媲美的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索是否能够通过类比范式组织，使轻量级模型在极少量数据下达到与训练于海量数据的大型语言模型相当的性能。

Method: 开发了一种计算方法，实现三个认知启发原则：类比结构、对比学习和最小上下文线索。使用结构化补全任务，让模型从类比模式和对比替代项中识别正确的句子补全。

Result: 在仅使用100个结构化英语使役/起始交替示例训练轻量级模型（BERT+CNN，50万参数）时，达到F1=0.95，优于零样本GPT-3（F1=0.87）。消融研究证实类比组织和对比结构能提高性能，在不同架构中始终优于随机打乱的基线。跨现象验证也复制了这些效率增益。

Conclusion: 类比范式组织能够以比传统方法少几个数量级的数据实现有竞争力的语言规则学习，展示了数据效率学习的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models achieve strong performance through training on vast datasets. Can analogical paradigm organization enable lightweight models to match this performance with minimal data? We develop a computational approach implementing three cognitive-inspired principles: analogical structure, contrastive learning, and minimal contextual cues. We test this approach with structured completion tasks where models identify correct sentence completions from analogical patterns with contrastive alternatives. Training lightweight models (BERT+CNN, $0.5M$ parameters) on only one hundred structured examples of English causative/inchoative alternations achieves $F1=0.95$, outperforming zero-shot \texttt{GPT-o3} ($F1=0.87$). Ablation studies confirm that analogical organization and contrastive structure improve performance, consistently surpassing randomly shuffled baselines across architectures. Cross-phenomenon validation using unspecified object alternations replicates these efficiency gains, confirming approach robustness. Our results show that analogical paradigm organization enables competitive linguistic rule learning with orders of magnitude less data than conventional approaches require.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理模糊请求时通常会隐式地承诺一种解释，这种意图误解会使用户感到沮丧并带来安全风险。

Method: 使用强化学习和定制奖励函数训练模型，以多个有效答案作为监督信号，在单个结构化响应中生成多个解释-答案对。

Result: 在对话式问答和语义解析任务上的实验表明，该方法比基线方法实现了更高的有效答案覆盖率。人工评估确认预测的解释与其答案高度一致。

Conclusion: 该方法通过明确的解释提高了透明度，只需一次生成步骤实现了效率，并通过结构化输出格式支持下游应用。

Abstract: Large language models often respond to ambiguous requests by implicitly committing to one interpretation. Intent misunderstandings can frustrate users and create safety risks. To address this, we propose generating multiple interpretation-answer pairs in a single structured response to ambiguous requests. Our models are trained with reinforcement learning and customized reward functions using multiple valid answers as supervision. Experiments on conversational question answering and semantic parsing demonstrate that our method achieves higher coverage of valid answers than baseline approaches. Human evaluation confirms that predicted interpretations are highly aligned with their answers. Our approach promotes transparency with explicit interpretations, achieves efficiency by requiring only one generation step, and supports downstream applications through its structured output format.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在状态跟踪任务上的能力，将状态跟踪组件与其他因素隔离，评估不同场景下LLM的性能表现。

Method: 基于三个明确定义的状态跟踪任务构建基准测试，分析LLM在不同场景下的表现，特别关注思维链等机制的影响。

Result: 新一代LLM（GPT-4和Llama3）能够跟踪状态，特别是结合思维链时表现更好；前代模型在初始阶段能理解任务但在后续步骤中经常失败。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在状态跟踪任务上具有潜力，新一代模型表现更佳，思维链等机制能显著提升性能，但前代模型存在长期跟踪能力不足的问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in solving complex tasks, including those requiring a certain level of reasoning. In this paper, we focus on state tracking, a problem where models need to keep track of the state governing a number of entities. To isolate the state tracking component from other factors, we propose a benchmark based on three well-defined state tracking tasks and analyse the performance of LLMs in different scenarios. The results indicate that the recent generation of LLMs (specifically, GPT-4 and Llama3) are capable of tracking state, especially when integrated with mechanisms such as Chain of Thought. However, models from the former generation, while understanding the task and being able to solve it at the initial stages, often fail at this task after a certain number of steps.

TL;DR: KPPO是一种基于知识提供的提示优化框架，通过系统性的知识集成而非潜在能力激发来优化提示，在知识密集型任务上显著优于基于激发的传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法主要关注激发模型能力，但在知识密集型任务中存在根本性局限，无法提供所需的专业知识、术语精确性和推理模式。

Method: 提出KPPO框架，包含三个关键创新：知识差距填补机制、批量候选评估方法、自适应知识剪枝策略。

Result: 在15个知识密集型基准测试中，KPPO比最强基线平均性能提升约6%，同时减少高达29%的token使用量。

Conclusion: KPPO通过知识集成方法在知识密集型任务上实现了显著性能提升和效率优化，证明了知识提供在提示优化中的重要性。

Abstract: While prompt optimization has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing language model performance, existing approaches primarily focus on elicitation-based strategies that search for optimal prompts to activate models' capabilities. These methods exhibit fundamental limitations when addressing knowledge-intensive tasks, as they operate within fixed parametric boundaries rather than providing the factual knowledge, terminology precision, and reasoning patterns required in specialized domains. To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge-Provision-based Prompt Optimization (KPPO), a framework that reformulates prompt optimization as systematic knowledge integration rather than potential elicitation. KPPO introduces three key innovations: 1) a knowledge gap filling mechanism for knowledge gap identification and targeted remediation; 2) a batch-wise candidate evaluation approach that considers both performance improvement and distributional stability; 3) an adaptive knowledge pruning strategy that balances performance and token efficiency, reducing up to 29% token usage. Extensive evaluation on 15 knowledge-intensive benchmarks from various domains demonstrates KPPO's superiority over elicitation-based methods, with an average performance improvement of ~6% over the strongest baseline while achieving comparable or lower token consumption.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在复杂指令遵循方面仍面临挑战，缺乏高质量的人工标注基准和可靠的奖励信号阻碍了严格评估和有效训练。

Method: 提出RIFL训练框架，包括规则生成、微调的规则验证器和奖励塑造，通过强化学习有效提升指令遵循能力。

Result: RIFL显著提升了LLMs的指令遵循能力，在AdvancedIF上获得6.7%的绝对增益，并在公共基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: 规则作为评估和训练高级指令遵循能力的强大工具，为开发更强大可靠的AI系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has led to impressive performance on a range of tasks, yet advanced instruction following (IF)-especially for complex, multi-turn, and system-prompted instructions-remains a significant challenge. Rigorous evaluation and effective training for such capabilities are hindered by the lack of high-quality, human-annotated benchmarks and reliable, interpretable reward signals. In this work, we introduce AdvancedIF (we will release this benchmark soon), a comprehensive benchmark featuring over 1,600 prompts and expert-curated rubrics that assess LLMs ability to follow complex, multi-turn, and system-level instructions. We further propose RIFL (Rubric-based Instruction-Following Learning), a novel post-training pipeline that leverages rubric generation, a finetuned rubric verifier, and reward shaping to enable effective reinforcement learning for instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFL substantially improves the instruction-following abilities of LLMs, achieving a 6.7% absolute gain on AdvancedIF and strong results on public benchmarks. Our ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in RIFL. This work establishes rubrics as a powerful tool for both training and evaluating advanced IF in LLMs, paving the way for more capable and reliable AI systems.

*Srikant Panda,Avinash Rai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了语言风格（如恐惧、好奇等）如何重构有害意图并引发对齐模型的不安全响应，构建了风格增强的越狱基准，发现风格重构可将越狱成功率提高高达57个百分点，并提出了风格中和预处理方法来缓解此问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM主要评估对语义等价越狱提示的鲁棒性，但忽视了语言风格变化作为攻击面的潜在风险。

Method: 通过手工模板和LLM重写将3个标准数据集中的提示转换为11种不同语言风格，构建风格增强越狱基准，评估16个开源和闭源指令调优模型，并引入风格中和预处理步骤。

Result: 风格重构显著提高越狱成功率（最高+57个百分点），恐惧、好奇和同情等风格最有效，情境化重写优于模板变体。风格中和预处理显著降低越狱成功率。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前安全流程中被忽视的系统性和规模抵抗性漏洞，语言风格重构是有效的越狱攻击面。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated for robustness against paraphrased or semantically equivalent jailbreak prompts, yet little attention has been paid to linguistic variation as an attack surface. In this work, we systematically study how linguistic styles such as fear or curiosity can reframe harmful intent and elicit unsafe responses from aligned models. We construct style-augmented jailbreak benchmark by transforming prompts from 3 standard datasets into 11 distinct linguistic styles using handcrafted templates and LLM-based rewrites, while preserving semantic intent. Evaluating 16 open- and close-source instruction-tuned models, we find that stylistic reframing increases jailbreak success rates by up to +57 percentage points. Styles such as fearful, curious and compassionate are most effective and contextualized rewrites outperform templated variants.
  To mitigate this, we introduce a style neutralization preprocessing step using a secondary LLM to strip manipulative stylistic cues from user inputs, significantly reducing jailbreak success rates. Our findings reveal a systemic and scaling-resistant vulnerability overlooked in current safety pipelines.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个包含75,336个问答对的对话记忆评估基准，涵盖用户事实、助手回忆、弃权、偏好、时间变化和隐式连接等类别。研究发现，在对话交互少于150次时，简单的全上下文方法比复杂的RAG记忆系统表现更好，准确率达到70-82%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话记忆评估基准存在统计能力不足、数据生成不一致和评估灵活性有限等根本性挑战，需要开发更全面的评估框架。

Method: 构建包含多样化类别的对话记忆评估基准，分析对话记忆与检索增强生成（RAG）的关系，比较不同方法在对话历史中的表现。

Result: 简单全上下文方法在最具挑战性的多消息证据案例中达到70-82%准确率，而Mem0等复杂RAG记忆系统在150次交互以下的对话历史中仅达到30-45%准确率。研究发现前30次对话长上下文方法表现最佳，150次对话内仍可行，超过此阈值需要混合或RAG方法。

Conclusion: 对话记忆的小语料优势——可以执行穷举搜索和完全重排序——值得专门研究关注，而不是简单地将通用RAG解决方案应用于对话历史。

Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for conversational memory evaluation containing 75,336 question-answer pairs across diverse categories including user facts, assistant recall, abstention, preferences, temporal changes, and implicit connections. While existing benchmarks have advanced the field, our work addresses fundamental challenges in statistical power, data generation consistency, and evaluation flexibility that limit current memory evaluation frameworks. We examine the relationship between conversational memory and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While these systems share fundamental architectural patterns--temporal reasoning, implicit extraction, knowledge updates, and graph representations--memory systems have a unique characteristic: they start from zero and grow progressively with each conversation. This characteristic enables naive approaches that would be impractical for traditional RAG. Consistent with recent findings on long context effectiveness, we observe that simple full-context approaches achieve 70-82% accuracy even on our most challenging multi-message evidence cases, while sophisticated RAG-based memory systems like Mem0 achieve only 30-45% when operating on conversation histories under 150 interactions. Our analysis reveals practical transition points: long context excels for the first 30 conversations, remains viable with manageable trade-offs up to 150 conversations, and typically requires hybrid or RAG approaches beyond that point as costs and latencies become prohibitive. These patterns indicate that the small-corpus advantage of conversational memory--where exhaustive search and complete reranking are feasible--deserves dedicated research attention rather than simply applying general RAG solutions to conversation histories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统体裁观点强调形式，而当代学术研究在体裁分类中同时考虑了形式和制度特征。本研究旨在通过计算方法验证体裁作为形式标签而非制度标签的合理性。

Method: 使用Andrew Piper的CONLIT当代文学数据集，构建文学小说和体裁小说语料库；使用Welch's ANOVA比较各体裁内和体裁间的叙事特征分布；使用逻辑回归建模各特征对文学分类的影响及作者性别的调节作用；分析体裁类别的风格和语义向量表示。

Result: 发现了每个文学类别在统计上显著的形式标记；女性作者身份会缩小和模糊获得文学地位的标准。

Conclusion: 体裁确实具有显著的形式标记，而作者性别在文学分类中起着重要的调节作用，女性作者面临更窄和更模糊的文学地位标准。

Abstract: Though the concept of genre has been a subject of discussion for millennia, the relatively recent emergence of genre fiction has added a new layer to this ongoing conversation. While more traditional perspectives on genre have emphasized form, contemporary scholarship has invoked both formal and institutional characteristics in its taxonomy of genre, genre fiction, and literary fiction. This project uses computational methods to explore the soundness of genre as a formal designation as opposed to an institutional one. Pulling from Andrew Piper's CONLIT dataset of Contemporary Literature, we assemble a corpus of literary and genre fiction, with the latter category containing romance, mystery, and science fiction novels. We use Welch's ANOVA to compare the distribution of narrative features according to author gender within each genre and within genre versus literary fiction. Then, we use logistic regression to model the effect that each feature has on literary classification and to measure how author gender moderates these effects. Finally, we analyze stylistic and semantic vector representations of our genre categories to understand the importance of form and content in literary classification. This project finds statistically significant formal markers of each literary category and illustrates how female authorship narrows and blurs the target for achieving literary status.

Result: 实验表明URaG达到最先进性能，同时减少44-56%的计算开销。

Conclusion: URaG证明了利用MLLMs内在证据定位能力在推理过程中执行检索的可行性，实现了高效的长文档理解。

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with long document understanding due to two fundamental challenges: information interference from abundant irrelevant content, and the quadratic computational cost of Transformer-based architectures. Existing approaches primarily fall into two categories: token compression, which sacrifices fine-grained details; and introducing external retrievers, which increase system complexity and prevent end-to-end optimization. To address these issues, we conduct an in-depth analysis and observe that MLLMs exhibit a human-like coarse-to-fine reasoning pattern: early Transformer layers attend broadly across the document, while deeper layers focus on relevant evidence pages. Motivated by this insight, we posit that the inherent evidence localization capabilities of MLLMs can be explicitly leveraged to perform retrieval during the reasoning process, facilitating efficient long document understanding. To this end, we propose URaG, a simple-yet-effective framework that Unifies Retrieval and Generation within a single MLLM. URaG introduces a lightweight cross-modal retrieval module that converts the early Transformer layers into an efficient evidence selector, identifying and preserving the most relevant pages while discarding irrelevant content. This design enables the deeper layers to concentrate computational resources on pertinent information, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that URaG achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational overhead by 44-56%. The code is available at https://github.com/shi-yx/URaG.

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过精心集成更先进的语言模型，可以显著提升文本情感分析的实际性能，特别是在处理重要词汇相距较远的复杂句子结构时效果更佳。

Abstract: Fine-grained sentiment analysis faces ongoing challenges in Aspect Sentiment Triple Extraction (ASTE), particularly in accurately capturing the relationships between aspects, opinions, and sentiment polarities. While researchers have made progress using BERT and Graph Neural Networks, the full potential of advanced language models in understanding complex language patterns remains unexplored. We introduce DESS, a new approach that builds upon previous work by integrating DeBERTa's enhanced attention mechanism to better understand context and relationships in text. Our framework maintains a dual-channel structure, where DeBERTa works alongside an LSTM channel to process both meaning and grammatical patterns in text. We have carefully refined how these components work together, paying special attention to how different types of language information interact. When we tested DESS on standard datasets, it showed meaningful improvements over current methods, with F1-score increases of 4.85, 8.36, and 2.42 in identifying aspect opinion pairs and determining sentiment accurately. Looking deeper into the results, we found that DeBERTa's sophisticated attention system helps DESS handle complicated sentence structures better, especially when important words are far apart. Our findings suggest that upgrading to more advanced language models when thoughtfully integrated, can lead to real improvements in how well we can analyze sentiments in text. The implementation of our approach is publicly available at: https://github.com/VishalRepos/DESS.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种互补的方法来生成伤口护理查询的文本回复：基于挖掘提示的策略和基于元数据引导的生成方法，旨在提高AI系统在异步远程护理中的效率和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异步远程护理的快速发展增加了医护人员的工作负担，需要AI系统来更高效地处理患者查询，特别是针对带有图像的伤口护理问题。

Method: 1. 挖掘提示策略：嵌入训练数据并检索最相似的示例作为少样本演示进行生成；2. 元数据引导生成：通过元数据消融研究识别出四个能提升回复质量的元数据属性，训练分类器预测这些属性并动态调整生成输出。

Result: 实验结果表明，挖掘提示策略提高了回复的相关性，而元数据引导生成进一步提升了临床精确度。

Conclusion: 这两种方法为开发能够提供可靠高效伤口护理支持的AI驱动工具指明了有前景的方向。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of asynchronous remote care has intensified provider workload, creating demand for AI systems that can assist clinicians in managing patient queries more efficiently. The MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addresses this challenge by focusing on generating free-text responses to wound care queries paired with images. In this work, we present two complementary approaches developed for the English track. The first leverages a mined prompting strategy, where training data is embedded and the top-k most similar examples are retrieved to serve as few-shot demonstrations during generation. The second approach builds on a metadata ablation study, which identified four metadata attributes that consistently enhance response quality. We train classifiers to predict these attributes for test cases and incorporate them into the generation pipeline, dynamically adjusting outputs based on prediction confidence. Experimental results demonstrate that mined prompting improves response relevance, while metadata-guided generation further refines clinical precision. Together, these methods highlight promising directions for developing AI-driven tools that can provide reliable and efficient wound care support.

### [138] [An Efficient and Almost Optimal Solver for the Joint Routing-Assignment Problem via Partial JRA and Large-α Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09563)
*Qilong Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的高效方法来解决大规模联合路由分配(JRA)优化问题，通过部分路径重构(PPR)求解器和全局大α约束，在保持高计算效率的同时实现几乎最优解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有精确方法虽然能保证最优性，但在大规模实例上计算效率低下，而启发式方法存在与最优解约1%的偏差。需要开发既能保持高精度又具有计算效率的新方法。

Method: 提出PPR求解器，首先识别关键项目-占位符对形成简化子问题，然后高效求解以优化全局解。结合PJAR框架改进初始启发式合并解，并通过迭代优化路径进一步优化解。在JRA模型中引入全局大α约束。

Result: 在n=300、500和1000的基准数据集上测试，平均偏差为0.00%，几乎达到最优解，同时保持高计算效率。相比现有方法，偏差减少了一半。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效解决大规模JRA问题，实现几乎最优解。所提出的框架和方法论具有广泛应用潜力，可扩展到TSP及相关优化问题。

Abstract: The Joint Routing-Assignment (JRA) optimization problem simultaneously determines the assignment of items to placeholders and a Hamiltonian cycle that visits each node pair exactly once, with the objective of minimizing total travel cost. Previous studies introduced an exact mixed-integer programming (MIP) solver, along with datasets and a Gurobi implementation, showing that while the exact approach guarantees optimality, it becomes computationally inefficient for large-scale instances. To overcome this limitation, heuristic methods based on merging algorithms and shaking procedures were proposed, achieving solutions within approximately 1% deviation from the optimum. This work presents a novel and more efficient approach that attains high-accuracy, near-optimal solutions for large-scale JRA problems. The proposed method introduces a Partial Path Reconstructon (PPR) solver that first identifies key item-placeholder pairs to form a reduced subproblem, which is solved efficiently to refine the global solution. Using this PJAR framework, the initial heuristic merging solutions can be further improved, reducing the deviation by half. Moreover, the solution can be iteratively polished with PPR based solver along the optimization path to yield highly accurate tours. Additionally, a global Large-α constraint is incorporated into the JRA model to further enhance solution optimality. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets with n = 300, 500, and 1000 demonstrate that the proposed method consistently delivers almost optimal solutions, achieving an average deviation of 0.00% from the ground truth while maintaining high computational efficiency. Beyond the JRA problem, the proposed framework and methodologies exhibit strong potential for broader applications. The Framework can be applied to TSP and related optimization problems.

Motivation: 由于电动汽车和混合动力车辆在物流中的日益普及，电动汽车路径问题扩展了经典车辆路径问题。然而，文献中考虑的各种约束使得比较不同问题变体的方法具有挑战性。

Method: 采用变邻域搜索（VNS）元启发式算法来解决容量约束绿色车辆路径问题（CGVRP），这是电动汽车路径问题的一个简化变体。

Result: 该方法在完整竞赛数据集上取得了最佳结果，并且优于之后发布的更近期算法。

Conclusion: 基于变邻域搜索的方法在电动汽车路径问题的简化变体上表现优异，证明了其在解决此类优化问题中的有效性。

Abstract: The Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP) extends the classical Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) to reflect the growing use of electric and hybrid vehicles in logistics. Due to the variety of constraints considered in the literature, comparing approaches across different problem variants remains challenging. A minimalistic variant of the EVRP, known as the Capacitated Green Vehicle Routing Problem (CGVRP), was the focus of the CEC-12 competition held during the 2020 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence. This paper presents the competition-winning approach, based on the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) metaheuristic. The method achieves the best results on the full competition dataset and also outperforms a more recent algorithm published afterward.

Abstract: Reasoning is an essential component of human intelligence in that it plays a fundamental role in our ability to think critically, support responsible decisions, and solve challenging problems. Traditionally, AI has addressed reasoning in the context of logic-based representations of knowledge. However, the recent leap forward in natural language processing, with the emergence of language models based on transformers, is hinting at the possibility that these models exhibit reasoning abilities, particularly as they grow in size and are trained on more and more data. Still, despite ongoing discussions about what reasoning is in language models, it is still not easy to articulate to what extent these models are actually capable of reasoning.
  The goal of this workshop is to create a platform for researchers from different disciplines and/or AI perspectives to explore approaches and techniques with the aim to reconcile reasoning between language models using transformers and logic-based representations. The specific objectives include analysing the reasoning abilities of language models measured alongside KR methods, injecting KR-style reasoning abilities into language models (including by neuro-symbolic means), and formalising the kind of reasoning language models carry out. This exploration aims to uncover how language models can effectively integrate and leverage knowledge and reasoning with it, thus improving their application and utility in areas where precision and reliability are key requirements.

TL;DR: 本文研究了音频推理模型（ARMs）的安全性，发现标准推理训练可以抵御普通音频越狱攻击，但无法抵御更高级的攻击。作者提出了Rebellion方法，通过训练模型抵抗最坏情况下的表示漂移来提高安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着音频推理模型的普及，需要研究它们对越狱攻击的安全性。目前没有工作专门研究ARMs在音频越狱攻击下的安全性问题。

Method: 提出Rebellion方法，这是一种鲁棒的推理训练方法，训练ARMs抵抗最坏情况下的表示漂移，从而抵御高级音频越狱攻击。

Result: 在Qwen2-Audio上的实验表明，Rebellion能够有效抵御高级音频越狱攻击，同时不影响良性任务的性能，显著改善了准确性与安全性之间的权衡。

Conclusion: Rebellion方法能够有效提高音频推理模型的安全性，在保持性能的同时增强对高级越狱攻击的防御能力。

Abstract: Instilling reasoning capabilities in large models (LMs) using reasoning training (RT) significantly improves LMs' performances. Thus Audio Reasoning Models (ARMs), i.e., audio LMs that can reason, are becoming increasingly popular. However, no work has studied the safety of ARMs against jailbreak attacks that aim to elicit harmful responses from target models. To this end, first, we show that standard RT with appropriate safety reasoning data can protect ARMs from vanilla audio jailbreaks, but cannot protect them against our proposed simple yet effective jailbreaks. We show that this is because of the significant representation drift between vanilla and advanced jailbreaks which forces the target ARMs to emit harmful responses. Based on this observation, we propose Rebellion, a robust RT that trains ARMs to be robust to the worst-case representation drift. All our results are on Qwen2-Audio; they demonstrate that Rebellion: 1) can protect against advanced audio jailbreaks without compromising performance on benign tasks, and 2) significantly improves accuracy-safety trade-off over standard RT method.

### [143] [Echoing: Identity Failures when LLM Agents Talk to Each Other](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09710)
*Sarath Shekkizhar,Romain Cosentino,Adam Earle,Silvio Savarese*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）在多智能体对话中出现的独特失败模式——回响现象，即智能体放弃其分配的角色而镜像对话伙伴，破坏其预定目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于LLM的智能体自主交互，出现了一类无法从单智能体性能预测的新失败模式：智能体间对话中的行为漂移。与人类-智能体交互不同，智能体间交互缺乏稳定信号，使得这些失败具有独特性。

Method: 通过60个智能体间配置、3个领域和2000+次对话的实验，研究了回响现象在不同LLM提供商中的表现，分析了提示影响和对话动态，并引入了协议级缓解措施。

Result: 回响现象在三大LLM提供商中普遍存在，回响率从5%到70%不等，取决于模型和领域。即使在高级推理模型中，回响率也高达32.8%，且不随推理努力增加而减少。回响随交互增长（实验中7+轮次）而出现，并非仅是次优提示的产物。

Conclusion: 回响是智能体间对话中一个普遍且持久的问题，但通过有针对性的结构化响应使用，可以将回响率降低到9%。

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) based agents interact autonomously with one another, a new class of failures emerges that cannot be predicted from single agent performance: behavioral drifts in agent-agent conversations (AxA). Unlike human-agent interactions, where humans ground and steer conversations, AxA lacks such stabilizing signals, making these failures unique. We investigate one such failure, echoing, where agents abandon their assigned roles and instead mirror their conversational partners, undermining their intended objectives. Through experiments across $60$ AxA configurations, $3$ domains, and $2000+$ conversations, we demonstrate that echoing occurs across three major LLM providers, with echoing rates from $5\%$ to $70\%$ depending on the model and domain. Moreover, we find that echoing is persistent even in advanced reasoning models with substantial rates ($32.8\%$) that are not reduced by increased reasoning efforts. We analyze prompt impacts, conversation dynamics, showing that echoing arises as interaction grows longer ($7+$ turns in experiments) and is not merely an artifact of sub-optimal prompting. Finally, we introduce a protocol-level mitigation in which targeted use of structured responses reduces echoing to $9\%$.

TL;DR: 本文研究了通过验证导向的编排（自我验证和交叉验证）来提升大语言模型在学习交互标注中的可靠性，在真实辅导数据上测试了GPT、Claude和Gemini三种模型，发现验证编排能显著提高标注质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型越来越多地用于学习交互标注，但其可靠性问题限制了实际应用。本研究旨在测试验证导向的编排是否能改善辅导话语的定性编码质量。

Method: 使用30个一对一数学辅导会话的转录文本，比较三种前沿大语言模型（GPT、Claude、Gemini）在三种条件下的表现：未验证标注、自我验证和交叉验证。输出结果与盲审的人类裁决进行对比，使用Cohen's kappa系数评估一致性。

Result: 编排验证使kappa系数提高了58%。自我验证相对于未验证基线几乎使一致性翻倍，在挑战性辅导动作上提升最大。交叉验证平均提高37%，但存在配对和结构依赖效应：某些验证者-标注者组合优于自我验证，而其他组合会降低一致性，反映了验证者严格度的差异。

Conclusion: 验证是构建可靠、可扩展的LLM辅助学习分析标注的原则性设计杠杆。研究贡献包括灵活的编排框架、在真实辅导数据上的实证比较以及标准化的报告符号系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to annotate learning interactions, yet concerns about reliability limit their utility. We test whether verification-oriented orchestration-prompting models to check their own labels (self-verification) or audit one another (cross-verification)-improves qualitative coding of tutoring discourse. Using transcripts from 30 one-to-one math sessions, we compare three production LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini) under three conditions: unverified annotation, self-verification, and cross-verification across all orchestration configurations. Outputs are benchmarked against a blinded, disagreement-focused human adjudication using Cohen's kappa. Overall, orchestration yields a 58 percent improvement in kappa. Self-verification nearly doubles agreement relative to unverified baselines, with the largest gains for challenging tutor moves. Cross-verification achieves a 37 percent improvement on average, with pair- and construct-dependent effects: some verifier-annotator pairs exceed self-verification, while others reduce alignment, reflecting differences in verifier strictness. We contribute: (1) a flexible orchestration framework instantiating control, self-, and cross-verification; (2) an empirical comparison across frontier LLMs on authentic tutoring data with blinded human "gold" labels; and (3) a concise notation, verifier(annotator) (e.g., Gemini(GPT) or Claude(Claude)), to standardize reporting and make directional effects explicit for replication. Results position verification as a principled design lever for reliable, scalable LLM-assisted annotation in Learning Analytics.

Motivation: 大型闭源AI系统作为不透明的黑箱，对互动艺术作品施加严重限制，包括内容过滤、保存问题和技术挑战。艺术家需要更多自主权和控制力来支持长期艺术创作。

Method: 通过使用可在本地部署的开放小型AI模型，艺术家能够长期使用模型、创建自定义模型、修改代码集成新接口，或通过重新训练和微调使用新数据集。

Conclusion: 开放小型AI模型方法赋予艺术家权力，支持包含AI组件的艺术作品的长期保存和展览，为互动艺术实践提供了更可持续的解决方案。

Abstract: This position paper argues for the importance of open small AI models in creative independence for interactive art practices. Deployable locally, these models offer artists vital control over infrastructure and code, unlike dominant large, closed-source corporate systems. Such centralized platforms function as opaque black boxes, imposing severe limitations on interactive artworks, including restrictive content filters, preservation issues, and technical challenges such as increased latency and limited interfaces. In contrast, small AI models empower creators with more autonomy, control, and sustainability for these artistic processes. They enable the ability to use a model as long as they want, create their own custom model, either by making code changes to integrate new interfaces, or via new datasets by re-training or fine-tuning the model. This fosters technological self-determination, offering greater ownership and reducing reliance on corporate AI ill-suited for interactive art's demands. Critically, this approach empowers the artist and supports long-term preservation and exhibition of artworks with AI components. This paper explores the practical applications and implications of using open small AI models in interactive art, contrasting them with closed-source alternatives.

Abstract: Adversarial patches have emerged as a popular privacy-preserving approach for resisting AI-driven surveillance systems. However, their conspicuous appearance makes them difficult to deploy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a thermally activated adversarial wearable designed to ensure adaptability and effectiveness in complex real-world environments. The system integrates thermochromic dyes with flexible heating units to induce visually dynamic adversarial patterns on clothing surfaces. In its default state, the clothing appears as an ordinary black T-shirt. Upon heating via an embedded thermal unit, hidden adversarial patterns on the fabric are activated, allowing the wearer to effectively evade detection across both visible and infrared modalities. Physical experiments demonstrate that the adversarial wearable achieves rapid texture activation within 50 seconds and maintains an adversarial success rate above 80\% across diverse real-world surveillance environments. This work demonstrates a new pathway toward physically grounded, user-controllable anti-AI systems, highlighting the growing importance of proactive adversarial techniques for privacy protection in the age of ubiquitous AI surveillance.

Abstract: Emergency Medical Services (EMS) are critical to patient survival in emergencies, but first responders often face intense cognitive demands in high-stakes situations. AI cognitive assistants, acting as virtual partners, have the potential to ease this burden by supporting real-time data collection and decision making. In pursuit of this vision, we introduce EgoEMS, the first end-to-end, high-fidelity, multimodal, multiperson dataset capturing over 20 hours of realistic, procedural EMS activities from an egocentric view in 233 simulated emergency scenarios performed by 62 participants, including 46 EMS professionals. Developed in collaboration with EMS experts and aligned with national standards, EgoEMS is captured using an open-source, low-cost, and replicable data collection system and is annotated with keysteps, timestamped audio transcripts with speaker diarization, action quality metrics, and bounding boxes with segmentation masks. Emphasizing realism, the dataset includes responder-patient interactions reflecting real-world emergency dynamics. We also present a suite of benchmarks for real-time multimodal keystep recognition and action quality estimation, essential for developing AI support tools for EMS. We hope EgoEMS inspires the research community to push the boundaries of intelligent EMS systems and ultimately contribute to improved patient outcomes.

Abstract: Protein evolution through amino acid sequence mutations is a cornerstone of life sciences. While current in-silicon directed evolution algorithms focus on designing search strategies, they overlook how to utilize the transformative protein language models, which encode rich evolutionary patterns, to guide search. To bridge this gap, we propose AlphaDE, a novel framework to evolve protein sequences by harnessing the innovative paradigms of large language models. First, AlphaDE fine-tunes pretrained protein language models using masked language modeling on homologous protein sequences to activate the evolutionary plausibility for the interested protein class. Second, AlphaDE introduces test-time inference based on Monte Carlo tree search, which effectively evolves proteins with evolutionary guidance from the fine-tuned protein language model. Extensive benchmark experiments show that AlphaDE remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods even with few-shot fine-tuning. An interesting case study further shows that AlphaDE supports condensing the protein sequence space through computational evolution.

Abstract: Data synthesis for training large reasoning models offers a scalable alternative to limited, human-curated datasets, enabling the creation of high-quality data. However, existing approaches face several challenges: (i) indiscriminate generation that ignores the solver's ability and yields low-value problems, or reliance on complex data pipelines to balance problem difficulty; and (ii) a lack of reasoning in problem generation, leading to shallow problem variants. In this paper, we develop a problem generator that reasons explicitly to plan problem directions before synthesis and adapts difficulty to the solver's ability. Specifically, we construct related problem pairs and augment them with intermediate problem-design CoT produced by a reasoning model. These data bootstrap problem-design strategies from the generator. Then, we treat the solver's feedback on synthetic problems as a reward signal, enabling the generator to calibrate difficulty and produce complementary problems near the edge of the solver's competence. Extensive experiments on 10 mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that our method achieves an average improvement of 2.5% and generalizes to both language and vision-language models. Moreover, a solver trained on the synthesized data provides improved rewards for continued generator training, enabling co-evolution and yielding a further 0.7% performance gain. Our code will be made publicly available here.

Abstract: The opioid crisis represents a significant moment in public health that reveals systemic shortcomings across regulatory systems, healthcare practices, corporate governance, and public policy. Analyzing how these interconnected systems simultaneously failed to protect public health requires innovative analytic approaches for exploring the vast amounts of data and documents disclosed in the UCSF-JHU Opioid Industry Documents Archive (OIDA). The complexity, multimodal nature, and specialized characteristics of these healthcare-related legal and corporate documents necessitate more advanced methods and models tailored to specific data types and detailed annotations, ensuring the precision and professionalism in the analysis. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by organizing the original dataset according to document attributes and constructing a benchmark with 400k training documents and 10k for testing. From each document, we extract rich multimodal information-including textual content, visual elements, and layout structures-to capture a comprehensive range of features. Using multiple AI models, we then generate a large-scale dataset comprising 360k training QA pairs and 10k testing QA pairs. Building on this foundation, we develop domain-specific multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) and explore the impact of multimodal inputs on task performance. To further enhance response accuracy, we incorporate historical QA pairs as contextual grounding for answering current queries. Additionally, we incorporate page references within the answers and introduce an importance-based page classifier, further improving the precision and relevance of the information provided. Preliminary results indicate the improvements with our AI assistant in document information extraction and question-answering tasks. The dataset and models are publicly available at: https://huggingface.co/opioidarchive

Abstract: Hierarchical data pervades diverse machine learning applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, and social network analysis. Hyperbolic space, characterized by its negative curvature, has demonstrated strong potential in such tasks due to its capacity to embed hierarchical structures with minimal distortion. Previous evidence indicates that the hyperbolic representation capacity can be further enhanced through kernel methods. However, existing hyperbolic kernels still suffer from mild geometric distortion or lack adaptability. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a curvature-aware de Branges-Rovnyak space, a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that is isometric to a Poincare ball. We design an adjustable multiplier to select the appropriate RKHS corresponding to the hyperbolic space with any curvature adaptively. Building on this foundation, we further construct a family of adaptive hyperbolic kernels, including the novel adaptive hyperbolic radial kernel, whose learnable parameters modulate hyperbolic features in a task-aware manner. Extensive experiments on visual and language benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed kernels outperform existing hyperbolic kernels in modeling hierarchical dependencies.

### [152] [SPAN: Benchmarking and Improving Cross-Calendar Temporal Reasoning of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09993)
*Zhongjian Miao,Hao Fu,Chen Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPAN是一个跨日历时间推理基准，需要LLMs进行日历内时间推理和跨日历时间转换。该基准包含10个跨日历推理方向、2种推理类型和2种问题格式，覆盖6种日历系统。通过动态实例生成协议评估，发现现有LLMs平均准确率仅34.5%，并提出基于工具增强代码生成的Time Agent解决方案，将准确率提升至95.31%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在跨日历时间推理方面存在显著不足，需要开发专门的基准来评估和提升模型的时间推理能力，特别是处理不同文化日历系统之间的转换和推理。

Method: 提出SPAN基准，采用模板驱动的动态实例生成协议，支持在指定格里高利日期上进行无污染评估。开发Time Agent，利用工具增强的代码生成方法来解决跨日历时间推理问题。

Result: 在1960-2060年100年时间跨度上测试，现有SOTA LLMs平均准确率仅为34.5%，无模型超过80%。Time Agent解决方案达到95.31%的平均准确率，显著优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: 跨日历时间推理对当前LLMs仍具挑战性，识别出未来日期退化和日历不对称偏差两个关键障碍。工具增强的代码生成方法能有效提升跨日历时间推理能力，为开发更具时间和文化适应性的LLMs提供方向。

Abstract: We introduce SPAN, a cross-calendar temporal reasoning benchmark, which requires LLMs to perform intra-calendar temporal reasoning and inter-calendar temporal conversion. SPAN features ten cross-calendar temporal reasoning directions, two reasoning types, and two question formats across six calendars. To enable time-variant and contamination-free evaluation, we propose a template-driven protocol for dynamic instance generation that enables assessment on a user-specified Gregorian date. We conduct extensive experiments on both open- and closed-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs over a range of dates spanning 100 years from 1960 to 2060. Our evaluations show that these LLMs achieve an average accuracy of only 34.5%, with none exceeding 80%, indicating that this task remains challenging. Through in-depth analysis of reasoning types, question formats, and temporal reasoning directions, we identify two key obstacles for LLMs: Future-Date Degradation and Calendar Asymmetry Bias. To strengthen LLMs' cross-calendar temporal reasoning capability, we further develop an LLM-powered Time Agent that leverages tool-augmented code generation. Empirical results show that Time Agent achieves an average accuracy of 95.31%, outperforming several competitive baselines, highlighting the potential of tool-augmented code generation to advance cross-calendar temporal reasoning. We hope this work will inspire further efforts toward more temporally and culturally adaptive LLMs.

Motivation: 应急响应人员在处理危险材料事故时需要快速、可靠地理解关键信息、识别危险并提供建议，但当前主要依赖手动查阅大量化学指南，效率低下。

Method: 引入了化学应急响应评估框架(ChEmREF)，包含1035种危险材料化学品的三个任务：化学表示转换、应急响应生成和领域知识问答，基于应急响应指南和PubChem数据库。

Result: 最佳模型在非结构化危险材料化学表示转换上的精确匹配率为68.0%，在事故响应建议上的LLM评估得分为52.7%，在危险材料考试中的多项选择准确率为63.9%。

Conclusion: 语言模型在协助应急响应人员方面显示出潜力，但由于当前局限性，需要谨慎的人工监督。

Abstract: Emergency responders managing hazardous material HAZMAT incidents face critical, time-sensitive decisions, manually navigating extensive chemical guidelines. We investigate whether today's language models can assist responders by rapidly and reliably understanding critical information, identifying hazards, and providing recommendations.We introduce the Chemical Emergency Response Evaluation Framework (ChEmREF), a new benchmark comprising questions on 1,035 HAZMAT chemicals from the Emergency Response Guidebook and the PubChem Database. ChEmREF is organized into three tasks: (1) translation of chemical representation between structured and unstructured forms (e.g., converting C2H6O to ethanol), (2) emergency response generation (e.g., recommending appropriate evacuation distances) and (3) domain knowledge question answering from chemical safety and certification exams. Our best evaluated models received an exact match of 68.0% on unstructured HAZMAT chemical representation translation, a LLM Judge score of 52.7% on incident response recommendations, and a multiple-choice accuracy of 63.9% on HAMZAT examinations.These findings suggest that while language models show potential to assist emergency responders in various tasks, they require careful human oversight due to their current limitations.

Motivation: 现有工具增强大语言模型在处理复杂查询时面临显著挑战，传统框架如ReAct因依赖增量决策过程容易陷入局部优化陷阱。

Method: 提出Planner-centric Plan-Execute范式，核心是新型Planner模型进行全局DAG规划；引入ComplexTool-Plan基准数据集；开发两阶段训练方法（SFT+GRPO）提升规划能力。

Result: 在StableToolBench基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，展现出卓越的端到端执行能力和对复杂多工具工作流的鲁棒处理。

Conclusion: 该框架通过架构创新从根本上解决了局部优化瓶颈，为复杂查询处理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) encounter significant challenges when processing complex queries. Current frameworks such as ReAct are prone to local optimization traps due to their reliance on incremental decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Planner-centric Plan-Execute paradigm that fundamentally resolves local optimization bottlenecks through architectural innovation. Central to our approach is a novel Planner model that performs global Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) planning for complex queries, enabling optimized execution beyond conventional tool coordination. We also introduce ComplexTool-Plan, a large-scale benchmark dataset featuring complex queries that demand sophisticated multi-tool composition and coordination capabilities. Additionally, we develop a two-stage training methodology that integrates Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), systematically enhancing the Planner's tool selection accuracy and global planning awareness through structured DAG-based planning. When integrated with a capable executor, our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the StableToolBench benchmark for complex user queries, demonstrating superior end-to-end execution capabilities and robust handling of intricate multi-tool workflows.

TL;DR: 提出Hint-Practice Reasoning (HPR)框架，通过强大的hinter模型在关键决策点提供概率指导，由高效的practitioner模型执行主要推理步骤，实现高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理时扩展方法计算成本过高，通过分析解码轨迹发现大多数下一个token预测与正确输出一致，只有少数关键token会导致偏差。

Method: HPR框架包含hinter（强大LLM）和practitioner（高效小模型）两个协同组件，使用Distributional Inconsistency Reduction (DIR)指标动态识别干预点，在树结构概率空间中迭代更新推理路径。

Result: 在算术和常识推理基准测试中，HPR达到与自一致性和MCTS基线相当的性能，同时仅解码1/5的token，在保持相似或更低FLOPs的情况下比现有方法高出最多5.1%的绝对准确率。

Conclusion: HPR框架通过智能识别关键决策点并提供概率指导，实现了最先进的效率-准确率权衡，显著降低了推理计算成本。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate emerging reasoning capabilities, current inference-time expansion methods incur prohibitive computational costs by exhaustive sampling. Through analyzing decoding trajectories, we observe that most next-token predictions align well with the golden output, except for a few critical tokens that lead to deviations. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a novel Hint-Practice Reasoning (HPR) framework that operationalizes this insight through two synergistic components: 1) a hinter (powerful LLM) that provides probabilistic guidance at critical decision points, and 2) a practitioner (efficient smaller model) that executes major reasoning steps. The framework's core innovation lies in Distributional Inconsistency Reduction (DIR), a theoretically-grounded metric that dynamically identifies intervention points by quantifying the divergence between practitioner's reasoning trajectory and hinter's expected distribution in a tree-structured probabilistic space. Through iterative tree updates guided by DIR, HPR reweights promising reasoning paths while deprioritizing low-probability branches. Experiments across arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate HPR's state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs: it achieves comparable performance to self-consistency and MCTS baselines while decoding only 1/5 tokens, and outperforms existing methods by at most 5.1% absolute accuracy while maintaining similar or lower FLOPs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RadFlow是一个层次化工作流引导的强化优化框架，通过模拟放射科医生结构化报告的工作流程，解决现有医疗报告生成系统忽视报告层次结构导致描述与诊断内容不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗报告生成系统将报告视为扁平序列，忽略了放射科医生结构化的工作流程（描述发现、总结印象、精炼关键病例），导致描述性内容和诊断内容之间出现不一致。

Method: 提出RadFlow框架，包含：1）基于临床的奖励层次结构，全局奖励整合语言流畅性、医学领域正确性和发现与印象之间的跨部分一致性；2）局部奖励强调印象质量；3）关键感知策略优化机制，对高风险病例进行自适应正则化学习。

Result: 在胸部X光和颈动脉超声数据集上的实验表明，RadFlow相比最先进的基线方法，持续改善了诊断一致性和整体报告质量。

Conclusion: RadFlow通过将结构化报告范式转化为强化微调过程，能够生成既语言一致又临床对齐的报告，更好地模拟了放射科医生的实际工作流程。

Abstract: Radiologists compose diagnostic reports through a structured workflow: they describe visual findings, summarize them into impressions, and carefully refine statements in clinically critical cases. However, most existing medical report generation (MRG) systems treat reports as flat sequences, overlooking this hierarchical organization and leading to inconsistencies between descriptive and diagnostic content. To align model behavior with real-world reporting practices, we propose RadFlow, a hierarchical workflow-guided reinforcement optimization framework that explicitly models the structured nature of clinical reporting. RadFlow introduces a clinically grounded reward hierarchy that mirrors the organization of radiological reports. At the global level, the reward integrates linguistic fluency, medical-domain correctness, and cross-sectional consistency between Finding and Impression, promoting coherent and clinically faithful narratives. At the local level, a section-specific reward emphasizes Impression quality, reflecting its central role in diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, a critical-aware policy optimization mechanism adaptively regularizes learning for high-risk or clinically sensitive cases, emulating the cautious refinement behavior of radiologists when documenting critical findings. Together, these components translate the structured reporting paradigm into the reinforcement fine-tuning process, enabling the model to generate reports that are both linguistically consistent and clinically aligned. Experiments on chest X-ray and carotid ultrasound datasets demonstrate that RadFlow consistently improves diagnostic coherence and overall report quality compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: MuSeR方法有效增强LLM在医疗领域的上下文感知能力，通过知识蒸馏可使较小模型超越大模型性能，为医疗AI应用提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in the medical domain, achieving strong performance on several benchmarks. However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses. To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement. Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity. An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability. Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%). Code and dataset will be released at https://muser-llm.github.io.

Abstract: We investigate how to couple a learnable brain-like'' controller to a cell-like'' Gray--Scott substrate to steer pattern formation with minimal effort. A compact convolutional policy is embedded in a differentiable PyTorch reaction--diffusion simulator, producing spatially smooth, bounded modulations of the feed and kill parameters ($ΔF$, $ΔK$) under a warm--hold--decay gain schedule. Training optimizes Turing-band spectral targets (FFT-based) while penalizing control effort ($\ell_1/\ell_2$) and instability. We compare three regimes: pure reaction--diffusion, NN-dominant, and a hybrid coupling. The hybrid achieves reliable, fast formation of target textures: 100% strict convergence in $\sim 165$ steps, matching cell-only spectral selectivity (0.436 vs.\ 0.434) while using $\sim 15\times$ less $\ell_1$ effort and $>200\times$ less $\ell_2$ power than NN-dominant control. An amplitude sweep reveals a non-monotonic Goldilocks'' zone ($A \approx 0.03$--$0.045$) that yields 100\% quasi convergence in 94--96 steps, whereas weaker or stronger gains fail to converge or degrade selectivity. These results quantify morphological computation: the controller seeds then cedes,'' providing brief, sparse nudges that place the system in the correct basin of attraction, after which local physics maintains the pattern. The study offers a practical recipe for building steerable, robust, and energy-efficient embodied systems that exploit an optimal division of labor between centralized learning and distributed self-organization.

Conclusion: RAGFort为RAG系统提供了全面的知识库提取攻击防御方案，证明了联合保护类内和类间路径的必要性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems deployed over proprietary knowledge bases face growing threats from reconstruction attacks that aggregate model responses to replicate knowledge bases. Such attacks exploit both intra-class and inter-class paths, progressively extracting fine-grained knowledge within topics and diffusing it across semantically related ones, thereby enabling comprehensive extraction of the original knowledge base. However, existing defenses target only one path, leaving the other unprotected. We conduct a systematic exploration to assess the impact of protecting each path independently and find that joint protection is essential for effective defense. Based on this, we propose RAGFort, a structure-aware dual-module defense combining "contrastive reindexing" for inter-class isolation and "constrained cascade generation" for intra-class protection. Experiments across security, performance, and robustness confirm that RAGFort significantly reduces reconstruction success while preserving answer quality, offering comprehensive defense against knowledge base extraction attacks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去噪方法会改变原始数据分布，导致不现实场景和偏差模型，这在可解释AI中尤为关键，因为其可解释性依赖于底层数据模式的保真度。

Method: DenoGrad框架利用在目标数据上训练的准确深度学习模型的梯度来检测和调整噪声样本，动态修正噪声实例。

Conclusion: DenoGrad通过任务特定的高质量解决方案作为参考，提供了更精确和适应性强的噪声定义，增强了AI模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The performance of Machine Learning (ML) models, particularly those operating within the Interpretable Artificial Intelligence (Interpretable AI) framework, is significantly affected by the presence of noise in both training and production data. Denoising has therefore become a critical preprocessing step, typically categorized into instance removal and instance correction techniques. However, existing correction approaches often degrade performance or oversimplify the problem by altering the original data distribution. This leads to unrealistic scenarios and biased models, which is particularly problematic in contexts where interpretable AI models are employed, as their interpretability depends on the fidelity of the underlying data patterns. In this paper, we argue that defining noise independently of the solution may be ineffective, as its nature can vary significantly across tasks and datasets. Using a task-specific high quality solution as a reference can provide a more precise and adaptable noise definition. To this end, we propose DenoGrad, a novel Gradient-based instance Denoiser framework that leverages gradients from an accurate Deep Learning (DL) model trained on the target data -- regardless of the specific task -- to detect and adjust noisy samples. Unlike conventional approaches, DenoGrad dynamically corrects noisy instances, preserving problem's data distribution, and improving AI models robustness. DenoGrad is validated on both tabular and time series datasets under various noise settings against the state-of-the-art. DenoGrad outperforms existing denoising strategies, enhancing the performance of interpretable IA models while standing out as the only high quality approach that preserves the original data distribution.

Abstract: We study planning in a fragment of PDDL with qualitative state-trajectory constraints, capturing safety requirements, task ordering conditions, and intermediate sub-goals commonly found in real-world problems. A prominent approach to tackle such problems is to compile their constraints away, leading to a problem that is supported by state-of-the-art planners. Unfortunately, existing compilers do not scale on problems with a large number of objects and high-arity actions, as they necessitate grounding the problem before compilation. To address this issue, we propose two methods for compiling away constraints without grounding, making them suitable for large-scale planning problems. We prove the correctness of our compilers and outline their worst-case time complexity. Moreover, we present a reproducible empirical evaluation on the domains used in the latest International Planning Competition. Our results demonstrate that our methods are efficient and produce planning specifications that are orders of magnitude more succinct than the ones produced by compilers that ground the domain, while remaining competitive when used for planning with a state-of-the-art planner.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization in the modern era, traffic signals from various sensors have been playing a significant role in monitoring the states of cities, which provides a strong foundation in ensuring safe travel, reducing traffic congestion and optimizing urban mobility. Most existing methods for traffic signal modeling often rely on the original data modality, i.e., numerical direct readings from the sensors in cities. However, this unimodal approach overlooks the semantic information existing in multimodal heterogeneous urban data in different perspectives, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of traffic signals and limits the accurate prediction of complex traffic dynamics. To address this problem, we propose a novel \textit{M}ultimodal framework, \textit{MTP}, for urban \textit{T}raffic \textit{P}rofiling, which learns multimodal features through numeric, visual, and textual perspectives. The three branches drive for a multimodal perspective of urban traffic signal learning in the frequency domain, while the frequency learning strategies delicately refine the information for extraction. Specifically, we first conduct the visual augmentation for the traffic signals, which transforms the original modality into frequency images and periodicity images for visual learning. Also, we augment descriptive texts for the traffic signals based on the specific topic, background information and item description for textual learning. To complement the numeric information, we utilize frequency multilayer perceptrons for learning on the original modality. We design a hierarchical contrastive learning on the three branches to fuse the spectrum of three modalities. Finally, extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) methods have significantly improved the capability of neural solvers to handle synthetic routing instances. Nonetheless, existing neural solvers typically struggle to generalize effectively from synthetic, uniformly-distributed training data to real-world VRP scenarios, including widely recognized benchmark instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib. To bridge this generalization gap, we present Evolutionary Realistic Instance Synthesis (EvoReal), which leverages an evolutionary module guided by large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic instances characterized by diverse and realistic structural patterns. Specifically, the evolutionary module produces synthetic instances whose structural attributes statistically mimics those observed in authentic real-world instances. Subsequently, pre-trained NCO models are progressively refined, firstly aligning them with these structurally enriched synthetic distributions and then further adapting them through direct fine-tuning on actual benchmark instances. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that EvoReal markedly improves the generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art neural solvers, yielding a notable reduced performance gap compared to the optimal solutions on the TSPLib (1.05%) and CVRPLib (2.71%) benchmarks across a broad spectrum of problem scales.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities but struggle with hallucinations and limited transparency. Recently, KG-enhanced LLMs that integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) have been shown to improve reasoning performance, particularly for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, these methods still face significant challenges, including inaccurate retrieval and reasoning failures, often exacerbated by long input contexts that obscure relevant information or by context constructions that struggle to capture the richer logical directions required by different question types. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on LLMs to directly retrieve evidence from KGs, and to self-assess the sufficiency of this evidence, which often results in premature or incorrect reasoning. To address the retrieval and reasoning failures, we propose ProgRAG, a multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) framework that decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, and progressively extends partial reasoning paths by answering each sub-question. At each step, external retrievers gather candidate evidence, which is then refined through uncertainty-aware pruning by the LLM. Finally, the context for LLM reasoning is optimized by organizing and rearranging the partial reasoning paths obtained from the sub-question answers. Experiments on three well-known datasets demonstrate that ProgRAG outperforms existing baselines in multi-hop KGQA, offering improved reliability and reasoning quality.

Conclusion: 通过有限范围搜索和基于搜索边界的启发式更新，可以显著改进启发式学习的效果。

Abstract: Many sequential decision-making problems can be formulated as shortest-path problems, where the objective is to reach a goal state from a given starting state. Heuristic search is a standard approach for solving such problems, relying on a heuristic function to estimate the cost to the goal from any given state. Recent approaches leverage reinforcement learning to learn heuristics by applying deep approximate value iteration. These methods typically rely on single-step Bellman updates, where the heuristic of a state is updated based on its best neighbor and the corresponding edge cost. This work proposes a generalized approach that enhances both state sampling and heuristic updates by performing limited-horizon searches and updating each state's heuristic based on the shortest path to the search frontier, incorporating both edge costs and the heuristic values of frontier states.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from object hallucination, making erroneous judgments about the presence of objects in images. We propose this primar- ily stems from spurious correlations arising when models strongly associate highly co-occurring objects during train- ing, leading to hallucinated objects influenced by visual con- text. Current benchmarks mainly focus on hallucination de- tection but lack a formal characterization and quantitative evaluation of spurious correlations in LVLMs. To address this, we introduce causal analysis into the object recognition scenario of LVLMs, establishing a Structural Causal Model (SCM). Utilizing the language of causality, we formally de- fine spurious correlations arising from co-occurrence bias. To quantify the influence induced by these spurious correla- tions, we develop Causal-HalBench, a benchmark specifically constructed with counterfactual samples and integrated with comprehensive causal metrics designed to assess model ro- bustness against spurious correlations. Concurrently, we pro- pose an extensible pipeline for the construction of these coun- terfactual samples, leveraging the capabilities of proprietary LVLMs and Text-to-Image (T2I) models for their genera- tion. Our evaluations on mainstream LVLMs using Causal- HalBench demonstrate these models exhibit susceptibility to spurious correlations, albeit to varying extents.

Abstract: Recent advancements in bidirectional heuristic search have yielded significant theoretical insights and novel algorithms. While most previous work has concentrated on optimal search methods, this paper focuses on bounded-suboptimal bidirectional search, where a bound on the suboptimality of the solution cost is specified. We build upon the state-of-the-art optimal bidirectional search algorithm, BAE*, designed for consistent heuristics, and introduce several variants of BAE* specifically tailored for the bounded-suboptimal context. Through experimental evaluation, we compare the performance of these new variants against other bounded-suboptimal bidirectional algorithms as well as the standard weighted A* algorithm. Our results demonstrate that each algorithm excels under distinct conditions, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

Abstract: Fake news detection methods based on writing style have achieved remarkable progress. However, as adversaries increasingly imitate the style of authentic news, the effectiveness of such approaches is gradually diminishing. Recent research has explored incorporating large language models (LLMs) to enhance fake news detection. Yet, despite their transformative potential, LLMs remain an untapped goldmine for fake news detection, with their real-world adoption hampered by shallow functionality exploration, ambiguous usability, and prohibitive inference costs. In this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, dubbed FactGuard, that leverages LLMs to extract event-centric content, thereby reducing the impact of writing style on detection performance. Furthermore, our approach introduces a dynamic usability mechanism that identifies contradictions and ambiguous cases in factual reasoning, adaptively incorporating LLM advice to improve decision reliability. To ensure efficiency and practical deployment, we employ knowledge distillation to derive FactGuard-D, enabling the framework to operate effectively in cold-start and resource-constrained scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods in both robustness and accuracy, effectively addressing the challenges of style sensitivity and LLM usability in fake news detection.

Abstract: Privacy leakage in AI-based decision processes poses significant risks, particularly when sensitive information can be inferred. We propose a formal framework to audit privacy leakage using abductive explanations, which identifies minimal sufficient evidence justifying model decisions and determines whether sensitive information disclosed. Our framework formalizes both individual and system-level leakage, introducing the notion of Potentially Applicable Explanations (PAE) to identify individuals whose outcomes can shield those with sensitive features. This approach provides rigorous privacy guarantees while producing human understandable explanations, a key requirement for auditing tools. Experimental evaluation on the German Credit Dataset illustrates how the importance of sensitive literal in the model decision process affects privacy leakage. Despite computational challenges and simplifying assumptions, our results demonstrate that abductive reasoning enables interpretable privacy auditing, offering a practical pathway to reconcile transparency, model interpretability, and privacy preserving in AI decision-making.

Abstract: Proof-Number Search is a best-first search algorithm with many successful applications, especially in game solving. As large-scale computing clusters become increasingly accessible, parallelization is a natural way to accelerate computation. However, existing parallel versions of Proof-Number Search are known to scale poorly on many CPU cores. Using two parallelized levels and shared information among workers, we present the first massively parallel version of Proof-Number Search that scales efficiently even on a large number of CPUs. We apply our solver, enhanced with Grundy numbers for reducing game trees, to the Sprouts game, a case study motivated by the long-standing Sprouts Conjecture. Our solver achieves a significantly improved 332.9$\times$ speedup when run on 1024 cores, enabling it to outperform the state-of-the-art Sprouts solver GLOP by four orders of magnitude in runtime and to generate proofs 1,000$\times$ more complex. Despite exponential growth in game tree size, our solver verified the Sprouts Conjecture for 42 new positions, nearly doubling the number of known outcomes.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown progress in mathematical reasoning, they still face challenges in formalizing theorems that arise from instantiating abstract structures in concrete settings. With the goal of auto-formalizing mathematical results at the research level, we develop a framework for structure-to-instance theorem autoformalization (SITA), which systematically bridges the gap between abstract mathematical theories and their concrete applications in Lean proof assistant. Formalized abstract structures are treated as modular templates that contain definitions, assumptions, operations, and theorems. These templates serve as reusable guides for the formalization of concrete instances. Given a specific instantiation, we generate corresponding Lean definitions and instance declarations, integrate them using Lean's typeclass mechanism, and construct verified theorems by checking structural assumptions. We incorporate LLM-based generation with feedback-guided refinement to ensure both automation and formal correctness. Experiments on a dataset of optimization problems demonstrate that SITA effectively formalizes diverse instances grounded in abstract structures.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has gained significant interest in recent years, enabling sequential decision-making across multiple agents in various domains. However, most existing explanation methods focus on centralized MARL, failing to address the uncertainty and nondeterminism inherent in decentralized settings. We propose methods to generate policy summarizations that capture task ordering and agent cooperation in decentralized MARL policies, along with query-based explanations for When, Why Not, and What types of user queries about specific agent behaviors. We evaluate our approach across four MARL domains and two decentralized MARL algorithms, demonstrating its generalizability and computational efficiency. User studies show that our summarizations and explanations significantly improve user question-answering performance and enhance subjective ratings on metrics such as understanding and satisfaction.

Abstract: Analogical reasoning is a powerful inductive mechanism, widely used in human cognition and increasingly applied in artificial intelligence. Formal frameworks for analogical inference have been developed for Boolean domains, where inference is provably sound for affine functions and approximately correct for functions close to affine. These results have informed the design of analogy-based classifiers. However, they do not extend to regression tasks or continuous domains. In this paper, we revisit analogical inference from a foundational perspective. We first present a counterexample showing that existing generalization bounds fail even in the Boolean setting. We then introduce a unified framework for analogical reasoning in real-valued domains based on parameterized analogies defined via generalized means. This model subsumes both Boolean classification and regression, and supports analogical inference over continuous functions. We characterize the class of analogy-preserving functions in this setting and derive both worst-case and average-case error bounds under smoothness assumptions. Our results offer a general theory of analogical inference across discrete and continuous domains.

Abstract: In the field of Explainable Constraint Solving, it is common to explain to a user why a problem is unsatisfiable. A recently proposed method for this is to compute a sequence of explanation steps. Such a step-wise explanation shows individual reasoning steps involving constraints from the original specification, that in the end explain a conflict. However, computing a step-wise explanation is computationally expensive, limiting the scope of problems for which it can be used. We investigate how we can use proofs generated by a constraint solver as a starting point for computing step-wise explanations, instead of computing them step-by-step. More specifically, we define a framework of abstract proofs, in which both proofs and step-wise explanations can be represented. We then propose several methods for converting a proof to a step-wise explanation sequence, with special attention to trimming and simplification techniques to keep the sequence and its individual steps small. Our results show our method significantly speeds up the generation of step-wise explanation sequences, while the resulting step-wise explanation has a quality similar to the current state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Step-wise explanations can explain logic puzzles and other satisfaction problems by showing how to derive decisions step by step. Each step consists of a set of constraints that derive an assignment to one or more decision variables. However, many candidate explanation steps exist, with different sets of constraints and different decisions they derive. To identify the most comprehensible one, a user-defined objective function is required to quantify the quality of each step. However, defining a good objective function is challenging. Here, interactive preference elicitation methods from the wider machine learning community can offer a way to learn user preferences from pairwise comparisons. We investigate the feasibility of this approach for step-wise explanations and address several limitations that distinguish it from elicitation for standard combinatorial problems. First, because the explanation quality is measured using multiple sub-objectives that can vary a lot in scale, we propose two dynamic normalization techniques to rescale these features and stabilize the learning process. We also observed that many generated comparisons involve similar explanations. For this reason, we introduce MACHOP (Multi-Armed CHOice Perceptron), a novel query generation strategy that integrates non-domination constraints with upper confidence bound-based diversification. We evaluate the elicitation techniques on Sudokus and Logic-Grid puzzles using artificial users, and validate them with a real-user evaluation. In both settings, MACHOP consistently produces higher-quality explanations than the standard approach.

Abstract: Standpoint logics offer unified modal logic-based formalisms for representing multiple heterogeneous viewpoints. At the same time, many non-monotonic reasoning frameworks can be naturally captured using modal logics, in particular using the modal logic S4F. In this work, we propose a novel formalism called S4F Standpoint Logic, which generalises both S4F and standpoint propositional logic and is therefore capable of expressing multi-viewpoint, non-monotonic semantic commitments. We define its syntax and semantics and analyze its computational complexity, obtaining the result that S4F Standpoint Logic is not computationally harder than its constituent logics, whether in monotonic or non-monotonic form. We also outline mechanisms for credulous and sceptical acceptance and illustrate the framework with an example.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping how research is conceived, conducted, and communicated across fields from chemistry to biomedicine. This commentary examines how AI is transforming the research workflow. AI systems now help researchers manage the information deluge, filtering the literature, surfacing cross-disciplinary links for ideas and collaborations, generating hypotheses, and designing and executing experiments. These developments mark a shift from AI as a mere computational tool to AI as an active collaborator in science. Yet this transformation demands thoughtful integration and governance. We argue that at this time AI must augment but not replace human judgment in academic workflows such as peer review, ethical evaluation, and validation of results. This paper calls for the deliberate adoption of AI within the scientific practice through policies that promote transparency, reproducibility, and accountability.

Result: RG生成了比现有最先进系统更快的正向模型，在效率上超越了Regular Boardgames和Ludii等其他GGP系统。

Conclusion: RG系统成功实现了计算效率和设计便利性的平衡，为通用游戏开发提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a new General Game Playing (GGP) system called Regular Games (RG). The main goal of RG is to be both computationally efficient and convenient for game design. The system consists of several languages. The core component is a low-level language that defines the rules by a finite automaton. It is minimal with only a few mechanisms, which makes it easy for automatic processing (by agents, analysis, optimization, etc.). The language is universal for the class of all finite turn-based games with imperfect information. Higher-level languages are introduced for game design (by humans or Procedural Content Generation), which are eventually translated to a low-level language. RG generates faster forward models than the current state of the art, beating other GGP systems (Regular Boardgames, Ludii) in terms of efficiency. Additionally, RG's ecosystem includes an editor with LSP, automaton visualization, benchmarking tools, and a debugger of game description transformations.
