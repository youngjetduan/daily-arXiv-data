This paper asks a precise, testable version of the \"runaway growth\" question: under what measurable conditions could capability escalate without bound in finite time, and under what conditions can that be ruled out? We develop an analytic framework for recursive self-improvement that links capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies. Physical and information-theoretic limits from power, bandwidth, and memory define a service envelope that caps instantaneous improvement. An endogenous growth model couples capital to compute, data, and energy and defines a critical boundary separating superlinear from subcritical regimes. We derive decision rules that map observable series (facility power, IO bandwidth, training throughput, benchmark losses, and spending) into yes/no certificates for runaway versus nonsingular behavior. The framework yields falsifiable tests based on how fast improvement accelerates relative to its current level, and it provides safety controls that are directly implementable in practice, such as power caps, throughput throttling, and evaluation gates. Analytical case studies cover capped-power, saturating-data, and investment-amplified settings, illustrating when the envelope binds and when it does not. The approach is simulation-free and grounded in measurements engineers already collect. Limitations include dependence on the chosen capability metric and on regularity diagnostics; future work will address stochastic dynamics, multi-agent competition, and abrupt architectural shifts. Overall, the results replace speculation with testable conditions and deployable controls for certifying or precluding an AI singularity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7814\u7a76AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u9650\u5236\u5b9a\u4e49\u670d\u52a1\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5185\u751f\u589e\u957f\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u533a\u5206\u8d85\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u4e9a\u4e34\u754c\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u63aa\u65bd\u6765\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6216\u6392\u9664AI\u5947\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4ec0\u4e48\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u80fd\u529b\u4f1a\u65e0\u9650\u589e\u957f\uff08\u5931\u63a7\u589e\u957f\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u4ec0\u4e48\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6392\u9664\u8fd9\u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u7528\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u53d6\u4ee3\u731c\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u9012\u5f52\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u957f\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u5efa\u8bbe\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7269\u7406\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u9650\u5236\u5b9a\u4e49\u670d\u52a1\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5185\u751f\u589e\u957f\u6a21\u578b\u8026\u5408\u8d44\u672c\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u6570\u636e\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5c06\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u5e8f\u5217\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u5931\u63a7\u4e0e\u975e\u5947\u5f02\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc1\u4e66\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u529f\u7387\u4e0a\u9650\u3001\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u95e8\u7b49\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u63aa\u65bd\u53d6\u4ee3\u4e86\u731c\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6216\u6392\u9664AI\u5947\u70b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Video-based assessment (VBA) offers an opportunity to generate data-driven insights to reduce variability, optimize training, and improve surgical performance. However, existing tools for workflow analysis remain difficult to standardize and implement. This study aims to develop and validate a VBA tool for workflow analysis across minimally invasive colorectal procedures. A Delphi process was conducted to achieve consensus on generalizable workflow descriptors. The resulting framework informed the development of a new VBA tool, ColoWorkflow. Independent raters then applied ColoWorkflow to a multicentre video dataset of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal surgery (CRS). Applicability and inter-rater reliability were evaluated. Consensus was achieved for 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps describing CRS workflows. ColoWorkflow was developed and applied to 54 colorectal operative videos (left and right hemicolectomies, sigmoid and rectosigmoid resections, and total proctocolectomies) from five centres. The tool demonstrated broad applicability, with all but one label utilized. Inter-rater reliability was moderate, with mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases and 0.66 for steps. Most discrepancies arose at phase transitions and step boundary definitions. ColoWorkflow is the first consensus-based, validated VBA tool for comprehensive workflow analysis in minimally invasive CRS. It establishes a reproducible framework for video-based performance assessment, enabling benchmarking across institutions and supporting the development of artificial intelligence-driven workflow recognition.

Traditional manual analysis approach is time-consuming and limited by human errors. To enhance efficiency and accuracy, large language models (LLMs) with strong analytical and inferencing capabilities can be employed. However, high-quality analysis reports with well-structured formatting cannot be obtained through a single instruction input to the LLM. To tackle this issue, we propose a method that first decomposes the complex task into several sub-tasks and designs effective system prompts and user prompts for each sub-task. Multi-round interactions with the LLM incorporating self-check and reflection are then conducted to enable structured data extraction as well as multi-step analysis and evaluation. Furthermore, custom tools are defined and invoked to generate figures and compute metrics. We also design multiple report templates, each tailored to a specific application and input data type, ensuring their adaptability across a variety of scenarios.

To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation, demonstrating that the choice of quality measure has a decisive impact on the characteristics of the selected set of solutions and that our proposed measure performs competitively or even favorably across a range of settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u526a\u679d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u591a\u8d62\u5bb6\u6295\u7968\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u96c6\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5177\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u53cd\u76f4\u89c9\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u526a\u679d\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u591a\u8d62\u5bb6\u6295\u7968\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u516c\u7406\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5404\u79cd\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u53cd\u76f4\u89c9\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u548c\u96be\u5904\u7406\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6240\u9009\u89e3\u96c6\u7279\u5f81\u6709\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions. We establish novel results for all argumentation semantics, including counting. Notably, the overhead caused by our DDG reductions cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u56fe\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u6811\u5bbd\u548c\u56e2\u5bbd\uff09\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u4e86\u5c06\u62bd\u8c61\u8bba\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a(Q)SAT\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5f52\u7ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7ebf\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u56e2\u5bbd\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u8bba\u8bc1\u8bed\u4e49\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u8ba1\u6570\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3SAT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u5c0f\u6811\u5bbd\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5173\u4e8e\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u56fe\u53c2\u6570\u56e2\u5bbd\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u80fd\u529b\u77e5\u4e4b\u751a\u5c11\u3002\u62bd\u8c61\u8bba\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u5411\u56fe\u4e14\u6d89\u53ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u6311\u6218\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u5019\u9009\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4ece\u8bba\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u5230(Q)SAT\u7684\u65b0\u5f52\u7ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f52\u7ea6\u80fd\u591f\u7ebf\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u56e2\u5bbd\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u6709\u5411\u5206\u89e3\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08DDG\uff09\u5f52\u7ea6\u3002", "result": "\u4e3a\u6240\u6709\u8bba\u8bc1\u8bed\u4e49\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u8ba1\u6570\uff09\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86DDG\u5f52\u7ea6\u7684\u5f00\u9500\u5728\u5408\u7406\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u542f\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u56e2\u5bbd\u7f16\u7801\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e3a\u62bd\u8c61\u8bba\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684(Q)SAT\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002"}}

Decision-makers often rank expected potential outcomes (or their corresponding utility and desirability) to compare the preferences of candidate actions. In this paper, we study new counterfactual decision-making rules by introducing two new metrics: the probabilities of potential outcome ranking (PoR) and the probability of achieving the best potential outcome (PoB).

This assumption is untested. We characterize temporal constraint processing across eight production-scale models (2.8-8B parameters) using deadline detection tasks, revealing systematic deployment risks: bimodal performance distribution (models achieve either 95% or 50% accuracy), extreme prompt brittleness (30-60 percentage point swings from formatting changes alone), and systematic action bias (100% false positive rates in failing models). Parameter count shows no correlation with capability in this range-a 3.8B model matches 7B models while other 7B models fail completely. Fine-tuning on 200 synthetic examples improves models with partial capability by 12-37 percentage points. We demonstrate that temporal constraint satisfaction cannot be reliably learned through next-token prediction on natural language, even with targeted fine-tuning. This capability requires architectural mechanisms for: (1) continuous temporal state representation, (2) explicit constraint checking separate from linguistic pattern matching, (3) systematic compositional reasoning over temporal relations. Current autoregressive architectures lack these mechanisms.

While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies.

These modifications enhance graph fidelity while preserving the core spectral reasoning pipeline. Experimental results on ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, and CLUTRR benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains (up to +3.8\\%), improved generalization to adversarial cases, and reduced inference noise. The novelty lies in performing semantic and symbolic refinement entirely upstream of the spectral inference stage, enabling efficient, interpretable, and scalable reasoning without relying on quadratic attention mechanisms. In summary, this work extends the Spectral NSR framework with modular, semantically grounded preprocessing steps that improve graph quality without altering the core spectral reasoning engine. The result is a more robust, interpretable, and scalable reasoning system suitable for deployment in open-domain and real-world settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u8c31\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u5408\u5e76\u3001\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u8574\u6db5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6838\u5fc3\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u56fe\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8c31\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5197\u4f59\u8282\u70b9\u3001\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u8fb9\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f3a\u5931\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u8bed\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884ctransformer\u8282\u70b9\u5408\u5e76\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3NLI\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u8574\u6db5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fb9\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b3) \u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee5\u8865\u5145\u7f3a\u5931\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "result": "\u5728ProofWriter\u3001EntailmentBank\u548cCLUTRR\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad83.8%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u4e4b\u524d\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u7cbe\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8c\u6b21\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u9886\u57df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Existing multi-objective alignment methods rely on manually specified preference weights, which not only burden users with difficult preference specification tasks but also lead to suboptimal training efficiency due to exploration of irrelevant preference combinations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel framework named PRO, i.e., PReference Orchestrator, which features a lightweight preference adapter that automatically infers prompt-specific preference weights during both training and deployment phases. Specifically, the adapter automatically learns appropriate preference weights for each prompt by training on normalized reward scores from multiple reward models for preferred responses, which inherently reflect effective preference balances across objectives. Additionally, We provide theoretical analysis proving that our prompt-aware preference mechanism achieves superior performance compared to fixed preference weights in multi-objective alignment scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over existing multi-objective alignment approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPRO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u504f\u597d\u9002\u914d\u5668\u81ea\u52a8\u63a8\u65ad\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u504f\u597d\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u624b\u52a8\u6307\u5b9a\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u52a8\u6307\u5b9a\u504f\u597d\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u7528\u6237\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u8fd8\u56e0\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u504f\u597d\u7ec4\u5408\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "PRO\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u504f\u597d\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u9002\u5f53\u504f\u597d\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u63d0\u793a\u611f\u77e5\u504f\u597d\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u6743\u91cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PRO\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u63a8\u65ad\u63d0\u793a\u7279\u5b9a\u504f\u597d\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u597d\u6743\u91cd\u6307\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, existing embedding methods face critical limitations when modeling diverse relationship types at scale: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. We propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple.

We first identify a patent-specific failure mode of SimCSE style dropout augmentation: it produces overly uniform embeddings that lose semantic cohesion. To remedy this, we propose section-based augmentation, where different sections of a patent (e.g., abstract, claims, background) serve as complementary views. This design introduces natural semantic and structural diversity, mitigating over-dispersion and yielding embeddings that better preserve both global structure and local continuity. On large-scale benchmarks, our fully self-supervised method matches or surpasses citation-and IPC-supervised baselines in prior-art retrieval and classification, while avoiding reliance on brittle or incomplete annotations. Our analysis further shows that different sections specialize for different tasks-claims and summaries benefit retrieval, while background sections aid classification-highlighting the value of patents' inherent discourse structure for representation learning.

To address this, we propose PhaseWin, a novel phase-window search algorithm that enables faithful region attribution with near-linear complexity. PhaseWin replaces traditional quadratic-cost greedy selection with a phased coarse-to-fine search, combining adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision mechanisms to closely approximate greedy behavior while dramatically reducing model evaluations. Theoretically, PhaseWin retains near-greedy approximation guarantees under mild monotone submodular assumptions. Empirically, PhaseWin achieves over 95% of greedy attribution faithfulness using only 20% of the computational budget, and consistently outperforms other attribution baselines across object detection and visual grounding tasks with Grounding DINO and Florence-2.

This study develops a multi-agent AI framework that reconstructs pre-crash scenarios and infers vehicle behaviors from fragmented collision data. We present a two-phase collaborative framework combining reconstruction and reasoning phases. The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset. The system maintained robust performance even when processing incomplete data, including missing or erroneous EDR records and ambiguous scene diagrams. This study demonstrates superior AI capabilities in processing heterogeneous collision data, providing unprecedented precision in reconstructing impact dynamics and characterizing pre-crash behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u4e8b\u6545\u524d\u573a\u666f\u5e76\u63a8\u65ad\u8f66\u8f86\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u534f\u4f5c\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u572839\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u8ffd\u5c3e\u4e8b\u6545\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86100%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb692%\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u6545\u91cd\u5efa\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u5f80\u5f80\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u78b0\u649e\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cbe\u786e\u91cd\u5efa\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4ece\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4e8b\u6545\u91cd\u5efa\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u8bb0\u5f55\u5668\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u4e8b\u6545\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u5904\u7406\u4e86277\u8d77\u8ffd\u5c3e\u524d\u8f66\u51cf\u901f\u4e8b\u6545\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6587\u672c\u62a5\u544a\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u683c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u572839\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u8ffd\u5c3e\u4e8b\u6545\u6848\u4f8b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86100%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u76f8\u5173EDR\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e76\u6b63\u786e\u533a\u5206\u649e\u51fb\u4e0e\u88ab\u649e\u8f66\u8f86\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u545892%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u4e5f\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86AI\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u78b0\u649e\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5353\u8d8a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u78b0\u649e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u4e8b\u6545\u524d\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u3002"}}

We evaluated 15 open-weight LLMs on pathology and radiology reports across six use cases, colorectal liver metastases, liver tumours, neurodegenerative diseases, soft-tissue tumours, melanomas, and sarcomas, at three institutes in the Netherlands, UK, and Czech Republic. Models included general-purpose and medical-specialised LLMs of various sizes, and six prompting strategies were compared: zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and prompt graph. Performance was assessed using task-appropriate metrics, with consensus rank aggregation and linear mixed-effects models quantifying variance. Top-ranked models achieved macro-average scores close to inter-rater agreement across tasks. Small-to-medium general-purpose models performed comparably to large models, while tiny and specialised models performed worse. Prompt graph and few-shot prompting improved performance by ~13%. Task-specific factors, including variable complexity and annotation variability, influenced results more than model size or prompting strategy. These findings show that open-weight LLMs can extract structured data from clinical reports across diseases, languages, and institutions, offering a scalable approach for clinical data curation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f3015\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u548c\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d66\u79cd\u75be\u75c5\u7c7b\u578b\u548c3\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u673a\u6784\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u6709\u9650\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u82f1\u6587\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f00\u6e90LLMs\u5728\u591a\u75be\u75c5\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u591a\u673a\u6784\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bb0\u5f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u752815\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90LLMs\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u901a\u7528\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u57286\u79cd\u75be\u75c5\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5e94\u75286\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u5355\u6837\u672c\u3001\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u3001\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u3001\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u56fe\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u914d\u6307\u6807\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u6df7\u5408\u6548\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4e2d\u5c0f\u578b\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u56fe\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u7ea613%\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u6216\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u6e90LLMs\u80fd\u591f\u8de8\u75be\u75c5\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u673a\u6784\u4ece\u4e34\u5e8a\u62a5\u544a\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs). These prompts are subsequently optimized, with positive prompts focusing on features within each class, while negative prompts highlight features around category boundaries. Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, across eight OOD datasets and five different LLMs, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6b63\u8d1f\u63d0\u793a\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316LLM\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u8ba9\u8d1f\u63d0\u793a\u6355\u6349\u7c7b\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u7684OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1f\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u5f3a\u8c03\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u5185\u5bb9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63d0\u793a\u901a\u5e38\u5305\u542b\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u975eID\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6355\u83b7\u91cd\u53e0\u6216\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b21\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528LLM\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6b63\u8d1f\u63d0\u793a\uff1b2. \u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u6b63\u63d0\u793a\u5173\u6ce8\u7c7b\u5185\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8d1f\u63d0\u793a\u7a81\u51fa\u7c7b\u522b\u8fb9\u754c\u7279\u5f81\uff1b3. \u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u805a\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u8868\u793a\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u652f\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-100\u548cImageNet-1K\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u516b\u4e2aOOD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e94\u79cd\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6b63\u8d1f\u63d0\u793a\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u8868\u793a\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u754c\u5b9a\u4e86ID\u548cOOD\u56fe\u50cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u8fb9\u754c\u3002"}}

To support the creation of dynamic planning units, we introduce a planning support system with agentic AI that enables users to generate demand-oriented regions for disaster planning, integrating the human-in-the-loop principle for transparency and adaptability. The platform is built on a representative initialized spatially constrained self-organizing map (RepSC-SOM), extending traditional SOM with adaptive geographic filtering and region-growing refinement, while AI agents can reason, plan, and act to guide the process by suggesting input features, guiding spatial constraints, and supporting interactive exploration. We demonstrate the capabilities of the platform through a case study on the flooding-related risk in Jacksonville, Florida, showing how it allows users to explore, generate, and evaluate regionalization interactively, combining computational rigor with user-driven decision making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fdAI\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u9762\u5411\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u707e\u5bb3\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u533a\u57df\u5212\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5355\u5143\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u53e3\u666e\u67e5\u533a\u3001\u90ae\u653f\u7f16\u7801\u533a\u7b49\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u5f53\u5730\u793e\u533a\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6765\u5b9e\u65bd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u707e\u5bb3\u9884\u9632\u6216\u54cd\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6620\u5c04\uff08RepSC-SOM\uff09\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4f20\u7edfSOM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u7406\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u533a\u57df\u589e\u957f\u7ec6\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0cAI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u6574\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f5b\u7f57\u91cc\u8fbe\u5dde\u6770\u514b\u900a\u7ef4\u5c14\u5e02\u6d2a\u6c34\u76f8\u5173\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5e73\u53f0\u5982\u4f55\u8ba9\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5730\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u533a\u57df\u5212\u5206\uff0c\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u9a71\u52a8\u51b3\u7b56\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u89c4\u5212\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u521b\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u3001\u9700\u6c42\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u4e3a\u707e\u5bb3\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u5728\u56de\u8def\u539f\u5219\u786e\u4fdd\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

This study investigates the performance of two lightweight models, YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n, which are the nano variants of the latest official YOLO series, within a unified detection and classification framework for FER. Two benchmark classification datasets, FER2013 and KDEF, are converted into object detection format and model performance is evaluated using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. Results show that YOLOv12n achieves the highest overall performance on the clean KDEF dataset with a mAP 0.5 of 95.6, and also outperforms YOLOv11n on the FER2013 dataset in terms of mAP 63.8, reflecting stronger sensitivity to varied expressions. In contrast, YOLOv11n demonstrates higher precision 65.2 on FER2013, indicating fewer false positives and better reliability in noisy, real-world conditions. On FER2013, both models show more confusion between visually similar expressions, while clearer class separation is observed on the cleaner KDEF dataset. These findings underscore the trade-off between sensitivity and precision, illustrating how lightweight YOLO models can effectively balance performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate adaptability across both controlled and real-world conditions, establishing these models as strong candidates for real-time, resource-constrained emotion-aware AI applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86YOLOv11n\u548cYOLOv12n\u4e24\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0YOLOv12n\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u800cYOLOv11n\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7YOLO\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5c06FER2013\u548cKDEF\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528mAP 0.5\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u6df7\u6dc6\u77e9\u9635\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "YOLOv12n\u5728\u5e72\u51c0KDEF\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f9795.6 mAP 0.5\u7684\u6700\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728FER2013\u4e0amAP\u4e3a63.8\uff1bYOLOv11n\u5728FER2013\u4e0a\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u8fbe65.2\uff0c\u5047\u9633\u6027\u66f4\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7YOLO\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u611f\u77e5AI\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\u8111\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u8111\u8fde\u63a5\u7ec4\u4f5c\u4e3a\u75be\u75c5\u4f20\u64ad\u57fa\u8d28\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u75c5\u7406\u4f20\u64ad\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7eaf\u7cb9\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u5f53\u7ea6\u675f\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u533a\u57df\u53d8\u91cf\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u5408\u6210\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6837\u75be\u75c5\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u957f\u671f\u75be\u75c5\u8f68\u8ff9\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u751f\u7269\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u961f\u5217\u7684tau-PET\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u989d\u5916\u75be\u75c5\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408LLM\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u75be\u75c5\u4f20\u64ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Traditional universal compressors like gzip offer low computational overhead, high speed, and broad applicability across data distributions. However, they often lead to worse compression rates than modern neural compressors, which leverage large-scale training data to model data distributions more effectively. Despite their advantages, neural compressors struggle to generalize to unseen data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that performs Test-Time Steering via a Weighted Product of Experts (wPoE). At inference, our method adaptively combines a universal compression model with a pretrained neural language model, ensuring the compression rate is at least as good as that of the best individual model.

However, heterogeneous architecture distillation, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) to ResNet18, faces challenges due to differences in spatial feature representations.Traditional KD methods are mostly designed for homogeneous architectures and hence struggle to effectively address the disparity. Although heterogeneous KD approaches have been developed recently to solve these issues, they often incur high computational costs and complex designs, or overly rely on logit alignment, which limits their ability to leverage the complementary features. To overcome these limitations, we propose Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD),a simple yet effective framework that integrates complementary teacher and student features to align representations in shared logits.These logits are decomposed and constrained to facilitate diverse knowledge transfer to the student. Specifically, HCD processes the student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates them with teacher's feature from the penultimate layer and then maps them via the Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) module, comprising fully connected layer,to produce shared logits.We further introduce Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) that partitions the shared logits into n sub-logits, which are fused with teacher's logits to rectify classification.To ensure sub-logit diversity and reduce redundant knowledge transfer, we propose an Orthogonality Loss (OL).By preserving student-specific strengths and leveraging teacher knowledge,HCD enhances robustness and generalization in students.Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100, Fine-grained (e.g., CUB200)and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods,establishing it as an effective solution for heterogeneous KD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784\u4e92\u8865\u84b8\u998f\uff08HCD\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5f02\u6784\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5982ViT\u5230ResNet18\uff09\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u5dee\u5f02\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u5171\u4eablogits\u4e2d\u5bf9\u9f50\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50logit\u89e3\u8026\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f02\u6784\u67b6\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u9762\u4e34\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u540c\u6784\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56logit\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "HCD\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5377\u79ef\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6c60\u5316\u5904\u7406\u5b66\u751f\u4e2d\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2\uff09\u4e0e\u6559\u5e08\u5012\u6570\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u62fc\u63a5\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u5668\uff08CFM\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u5171\u4eablogits\uff1b4\uff09\u5b50logit\u89e3\u8026\u84b8\u998f\uff08SDD\uff09\u5c06\u5171\u4eablogits\u5212\u5206\u4e3an\u4e2a\u5b50logits\uff1b5\uff09\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u635f\u5931\uff08OL\uff09\u786e\u4fdd\u5b50logit\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-100\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5982CUB200\uff09\u548cImageNet-1K\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHCD\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "HCD\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u5b66\u751f\u7279\u5b9a\u4f18\u52bf\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Such evaluations often rely on a curated benchmark set of input prompts provided to the LLM, where the output for each prompt may be assessed in a binary fashion (e.g., harmful/non-harmful or does not leak/leaks sensitive information), and the aggregation of binary scores is used to evaluate the LLM. However, existing approaches to evaluation often neglect statistical uncertainty quantification. With an applied statistics audience in mind, we provide background on LLM text generation and evaluation, and then describe a Bayesian approach for quantifying uncertainty in binary evaluation metrics. We focus in particular on uncertainty that is induced by the probabilistic text generation strategies typically deployed in LLM-based systems. We present two case studies applying this approach: 1) evaluating refusal rates on a benchmark of adversarial inputs designed to elicit harmful responses, and 2) evaluating pairwise preferences of one LLM over another on a benchmark of open-ended interactive dialogue examples.

Many existing works attempt to address this issue by leveraging model representations (e.g., mean feature vectors) to correct local training; however, they often face two key limitations: 1) Incomplete Contextual Representation Learning: Current approaches primarily focus on final-layer features, overlooking critical multi-level cues and thus diluting essential context for accurate segmentation. 2) Layerwise Style Bias Accumulation: Although utilizing representations can partially align global features, these methods neglect domain-specific biases within intermediate layers, allowing style discrepancies to build up and reduce model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose FedBCS to bridge feature representation gaps via domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration into prototype construction that not only decouples content-style representations but also learns optimal style parameters, enabling more robust domain-invariant prototypes. Furthermore, we design a context-aware dual-level prototype alignment method that extracts domain-invariant prototypes from different layers of both encoder and decoder and fuses them with contextual information for finer-grained representation alignment.

Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual \"knowledge\" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts. It also identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to agent goals and aligned with human expectations.

We combine \\textbf{human evaluations} (rating fluency, factual accuracy, and cultural appropriateness) with automated metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) to assess model performance.\n  Our results reveal that while the largest proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5) generally lead across languages and tasks, significant gaps persist in culturally nuanced understanding and morphological generalization. Notably, GPT-4o demonstrates robust multilingual performance even on cross-lingual tasks, and Claude~3.5~Sonnet achieves competitive accuracy on knowledge and reasoning benchmarks. However, all models struggle to some extent with the unique linguistic challenges of each language, such as Turkish agglutinative morphology and Cantonese colloquialisms. Smaller open-source models (LLaMA-2~13B, Mistral~7B) lag substantially in fluency and accuracy, highlighting the resource disparity.

We show that even meaning-preserving paraphrases can cause large fluctuations in safety scores, revealing a lack of semantic grounding. To address this, we introduce a practical, self-supervised framework for improving the semantic robustness of guard models. Our method leverages paraphrase sets to enforce prediction consistency using a novel, skew-aware aggregation strategy for robust target computation. Notably, we find that standard aggregation methods like mean and median can degrade safety, underscoring the need for skew-aware alternatives. We analyze six open-source guard models and show that our approach reduces semantic variability across paraphrases by ~58%, improves benchmark accuracy by ~2.5% on average, and generalizes to unseen stylistic variations.

Applying a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to this task enables spatio-temporal analysis of facial motion and provides interpretable descriptions. However, there are still two core challenges: (1) The entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues prevents the model from focusing on subtle motion; (2) Textual labels in existing MER datasets do not fully correspond to underlying facial muscle movements, creating a semantic gap between text supervision and physical motion. To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement. We first introduce Uni-MER, a motion-driven instruction dataset designed to align text with local facial motion. Its construction leverages dual constraints from optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and reasonable correspondence to the movements. We then design an architecture with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into independent and interpretable representations (structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics). By integrating the instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM, our method injects effective physical priors for micro expressions while also leveraging the cross modal reasoning ability of large language models, thus enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues. Experiments on multiple challenging MER benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, as well as a particular advantage in interpretable modeling of local facial motion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DEFT-LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u89e3\u8026\u5b9e\u73b0\u5fae\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u5916\u89c2\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\u7ea0\u7f20\u4ee5\u53ca\u6587\u672c\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0e\u9762\u90e8\u808c\u8089\u8fd0\u52a8\u8bed\u4e49\u9e3f\u6c9f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63a8\u65ad\u771f\u5b9e\u60c5\u7eea\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u9759\u6001\u5916\u89c2\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u963b\u788d\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u7ec6\u5fae\u8fd0\u52a8\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0e\u9762\u90e8\u808c\u8089\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u5bf9\u5e94\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDEFT-LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u6784\u5efaUni-MER\u8fd0\u52a8\u9a71\u52a8\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5149\u6d41\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u5355\u5143\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u7ea6\u675f\u786e\u4fdd\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5bf9\u5e94\u6027\u3002\u7136\u540e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8868\u5f81\uff08\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u8bed\u4e49\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u5fae\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u7279\u6b8a\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06Uni-MER\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u5bf9\u9f50\u77e5\u8bc6\u96c6\u6210\u5230DEFT-LLM\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5fae\u8868\u60c5\u6ce8\u5165\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7cbe\u786e\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u60c5\u7eea\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002"}}

Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to \"break\" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akg\u00fcn et al. 2025).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6253\u7834\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u5176\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5efa\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982Essence\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u9700\u8981\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u652f\u6301\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u8bb8\u591a\u95ee\u9898\u5305\u542b\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u6253\u7834\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u6c42\u89e3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u62bd\u8c61\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6253\u7834\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6253\u7834\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08Akg\u00fcn\u7b49\u4eba2025\u5e74\uff09\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6253\u7834\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

True LLM understanding, analogous to human expertise, requires making consistent, well-founded decisions across multiple instances and diverse domains, relying on relevant and domain-grounded decision factors. We introduce Structured Tabular Decision Simulations (STaDS), a suite of expert-like decision settings that evaluate LLMs as if they were professionals undertaking structured decision ``exams''. In this context, understanding is defined as the ability to identify and rely on the correct decision factors, features that determine outcomes within a domain. STaDS jointly assesses understanding through: (i) question and instruction comprehension, (ii) knowledge-based prediction, and (iii) reliance on relevant decision factors. By analyzing 9 frontier LLMs across 15 diverse decision settings, we find that (a) most models struggle to achieve consistently strong accuracy across diverse domains; (b) models can be accurate yet globally unfaithful, and there are frequent mismatches between stated rationales and factors driving predictions. Our findings highlight the need for global-level understanding evaluation protocols and advocate for novel frameworks that go beyond accuracy to enhance LLMs' understanding ability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86STaDS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u683c\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u62df\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u591a\u6570\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u56e0\u7d20\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u867d\u7136\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u4e0d\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u50cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u505a\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u6709\u4f9d\u636e\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5e76\u4f9d\u8d56\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u7840\u51b3\u7b56\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u683c\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u62df\uff08STaDS\uff09\uff0c\u5c06LLMs\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\"\u8003\u8bd5\"\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8054\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff1a(i)\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u7406\u89e3\uff0c(ii)\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c(iii)\u5bf9\u76f8\u5173\u51b3\u7b56\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u5bf99\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbfLLMs\u572815\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u51b3\u7b56\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff1a(a)\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u5f3a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b(b)\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u4f46\u5168\u5c40\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9648\u8ff0\u7406\u7531\u4e0e\u9a71\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u7d20\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9891\u7e41\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u5168\u5c40\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u5021\u5bfc\u8d85\u8d8a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u589e\u5f3aLLMs\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In this study, we demonstrate that allocating roles with differing viewpoints to specific positions significantly impacts MAD's performance in reasoning tasks. Specifically, we find a novel role allocation strategy, \"Truth Last\", which can improve MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks. To address the issue of unknown truth in practical applications, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy, which systematically simulates and optimizes its core mechanisms. MADC incorporates path consistency to assess agreement among independent roles, simulating the role with the highest consistency score as the truth. We validated MADC across a range of LLMs (9 models), including the DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Models, on challenging reasoning tasks.

In autonomous driving, this is crucial to avoid collisions and navigate in complex, dense traffic scenarios. One way to plan is to search for the best action sequence. However, this is challenging when all necessary components - policy, next-state predictor, and critic - have to be learned. Here we propose Differentiable Simulation for Search (DSS), a framework that leverages the differentiable simulator Waymax as both a next state predictor and a critic.

Previous studies tend to rely on the model itself to implicitly learn semantic modeling during training, and resort to inefficient and costly manual annotations for these two challenges. To mitigate these limitations, we propose enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) speech projector, where each expert specializes in the semantic subspace of a specific language, enabling fine-grained modeling of speech features. Additionally, we introduce a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes readily available monolingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) and monolingual ST data, facilitating speech-text alignment and improving translation capabilities. During training, we leverage a combination of language-specific loss and intra-group load balancing loss to guide the MoE speech projector in efficiently allocating tokens to the appropriate experts, across expert groups and within each group, respectively. To bridge the data gap across different training stages and improve adaptation to the CS scenario, we further employ a transition loss, enabling smooth transitions of data between stages, to effectively address the scarcity of high-quality CS speech translation data.

Standard solutions, such as auxiliary load-balancing losses, can reduce load disparities but often weaken expert specialization and hurt downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose ERMoE, a sparse MoE transformer that reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an \"Eigenbasis Score\", defined as the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing ties token assignments directly to experts' representation spaces, stabilizing utilization and promoting interpretable specialization without sacrificing sparsity. Crucially, ERMoE removes the need for explicit balancing losses and avoids the interfering gradients they introduce. We show that ERMoE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (e.g., COCO, Flickr30K), while naturally producing flatter expert load distributions. Moreover, a 3D MRI variant (ERMoE-ba) improves brain age prediction accuracy by more than 7\\% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations.

Existing fine-tuning methods offer limited improvement, failing to deeply intervene in factual reasoning. This paper introduces Grounded Visual Factualization (GVF) Finetuning, a novel approach to systematically enhance MLLM visual factual consistency. GVF integrates explicit factual signals via three core mechanisms: Factual Anchor Data Augmentation, enriching training data with structured factual anchors and counter-factual prompts; Fact-Aware Instruction Tuning, embedding these cues into explicit instructions; and a Factual Consistency Loss function, specifically penalizing factual inaccuracies. Evaluated on LLaVA-1.5-13B, GVF Finetuning significantly outperforms standard fine-tuning on the VHTest benchmark for both Open-Ended Question (OEQ) and Yes/No Question (YNQ) formats. Crucially, GVF maintains or even slightly improves performance on general multimodal benchmarks like MME and POPE, demonstrating effective mitigation of visual hallucinations without compromising general understanding and reasoning abilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGVF\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8b\u5b9e\u951a\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u611f\u77e5\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u89c6\u89c9\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6df1\u5165\u5e72\u9884\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "GVF\u5fae\u8c03\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u4e8b\u5b9e\u951a\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff08\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e8b\u5b9e\u951a\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63d0\u793a\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff09\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u611f\u77e5\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u6574\uff08\u5c06\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ebf\u7d22\u5d4c\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u6307\u4ee4\uff09\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u4e13\u95e8\u60e9\u7f5a\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728LLaVA-1.5-13B\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cGVF\u5fae\u8c03\u5728VHTest\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u662f/\u5426\u95ee\u9898\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0a\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728MME\u548cPOPE\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u7565\u5fae\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "GVF\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While recent advances in vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong generalization across domains, extending them to continual settings remains challenging. In particular, learning task-specific soft prompts for newly introduced classes often leads to severe classifier bias, as the text prototypes overfit to recent categories when prior data are unavailable. In this paper, we propose DMC, a simple yet effective two-stage framework for CLIP-based CIL that decouples the adaptation of the vision encoder and the optimization of textual soft prompts. Each stage is trained with the other frozen, allowing one modality to act as a stable semantic anchor for the other to preserve cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, current CLIP-based CIL approaches typically store class-wise Gaussian statistics for generative replay, yet they overlook the distributional drift that arises when the vision encoder is updated over time. To address this issue, we introduce DMC-OT, an enhanced version of DMC that incorporates an optimal-transport guided calibration strategy to align memory statistics across evolving encoders, along with a task-specific prompting design that enhances inter-task separability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 demonstrate that both DMC and DMC-OT achieve state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT further improving accuracy by an average of 1.80%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DMC\u548cDMC-OT\u4e24\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8eCLIP\u7684\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eCLIP\u7684\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u6587\u672c\u539f\u578b\u4f1a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62df\u5408\u6700\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u50a8\u7684\u7c7b\u7ea7\u9ad8\u65af\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "DMC\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u6587\u672c\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\uff1bDMC-OT\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f15\u5165\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u6f14\u5316\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u95f4\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u589e\u5f3a\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-100\u3001Imagenet-R\u3001CUB-200\u548cUCF-101\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDMC\u548cDMC-OT\u90fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0cDMC-OT\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5c06\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e861.80%\u3002", "conclusion": "DMC\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86CLIP\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u800cDMC-OT\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u6821\u51c6\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We highlight how LLMs extract valuable information such as synthesis conditions from text, learn structure-property relationships, and can coordinate agentic systems integrating computational tools and laboratory automation. While progress has been largely dependent on closed-source commercial models, our benchmark results demonstrate that open-source alternatives can match performance while offering greater transparency, reproducibility, cost-effectiveness, and data privacy. As open-source models continue to improve, we advocate their broader adoption to build accessible, flexible, and community-driven AI platforms for scientific discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7efc\u8ff0\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u5927\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\uff1a\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u6316\u6398\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u603b\u7ed3\u5176\u5728\u6750\u6599\u53d1\u73b0\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7efc\u8ff0\u5206\u6790LLM\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff1a\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5408\u6210\u6761\u4ef6\u7b49\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u6784-\u6027\u8d28\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u534f\u8c03\u96c6\u6210\u8ba1\u7b97\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u95ed\u6e90\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3001\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u968f\u7740\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e94\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u793e\u533a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0AI\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

We trace this instability to the common extension of Rotary Position Embeddings to video through multimodal RoPE. The induced inverse Fourier time kernel exhibits frame-scale ripples that multiply adjacent frames by different factors, which perturbs attention that should otherwise be governed by the raw query key inner product. We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling. Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead.

Despite their unprecedented ability to synthesize information, a critical gap persists in evaluation: existing benchmarks primarily assess discriminative understanding or unconstrained image generation separately, failing to measure the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to not only understand and reason but to actively construct a solution, thereby setting a more rigorous standard for the next generation of intelligent systems.

We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality. Our theory formalizes how open-ended vision queries can be quantized to MCQs and further binarized into True/False verifications, establishing a hardness ladder. A simple analysis explains why Boolean resolution boosts accuracy. Together, these components yield a simple and unified workflow that emphasizes inference-time design over task-specific training.

Although the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) paradigm offers a promising solution by promoting consensus among multiple agents to enhance reliability, it relies on the unrealistic assumption that all debaters are rational and reflective, which is a condition that may not hold when agents themselves are prone to hallucinations. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol, inspired by social deduction games like \"Who is Undercover?\". MUG reframes MAD as a process of detecting \"undercover\" agents (those suffering from hallucinations) by employing multimodal counterfactual tests. Specifically, we modify reference images to introduce counterfactual evidence and observe whether agents can accurately identify these changes, providing ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enabling robust, crowd-powered multimodal reasoning. MUG advances MAD protocols along three key dimensions: (1) enabling factual verification beyond statistical consensus through counterfactual testing; (2) introducing cross-evidence reasoning via dynamically modified evidence sources instead of relying on static inputs; and (3) fostering active reasoning, where agents engage in probing discussions rather than passively answering questions.

However, the selection of in-context demonstrations plays a crucial role and can significantly affect LLMs' performance. Most existing demonstration selection methods primarily focus on semantic similarity between test inputs and demonstrations, often overlooking the importance of label distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage demonstration selection method, TopK + Label Distribution Divergence (L2D), which leverages a fine-tuned BERT-like small language model (SLM) to generate label distributions and calculate their divergence for both test inputs and candidate demonstrations.

While recent progress has shown promising results, they still suffer from two key limitations: (i) the reasoning processes lack the depth and iterative refinement characteristic of human cognition; and (ii) the reasoning processes exhibit instability, which compromises their reliability in downstream applications. In this work, we present STaR (slow-thinking for table reasoning), a new framework achieving cognitive table reasoning, in which LLMs are equipped with slow-thinking capabilities by explicitly modeling step-by-step thinking and uncertainty-aware inference. During training, STaR employs two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL), progressively learning from simple to complex queries under a composite reward. During inference, STaR performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification by integrating token-level confidence and answer consistency, enabling selection of more credible reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that STaR achieves superior performance and enhanced reasoning stability.

To overcome this challenge, a number of methods have been proposed, including the collection of prompt-image datasets and the integration of additional data modalities during training. Although these methods have shown promising results in general domains, they face limitations when applied to specialized fields such as medicine, where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available. We present CLUE (Controllable Latent space of Unprompted Embeddings), a generative model framework that achieves diverse generation while maintaining stability through fixed-format prompts without requiring any additional data. Based on the Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE employs a Style Encoder that processes images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are subsequently fed into a new second attention layer of the U-Net architecture. Through Kullback-Leibler divergence, the latent space achieves continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions, independent of prompts. Performance was assessed on otitis media dataset. CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). A classifier trained on synthetic-only data at 1000% scale achieved an F1 score of 83.21% (vs. 73.83%). Combining synthetic data with equal amounts of real data achieved an F1 score of 94.76%, higher than when using only real data. On an external dataset, synthetic-only training achieved an F1 score of 76.77% (vs. 60.61%) at 1000% scale. The combined approach achieved an F1 score of 85.78%, higher than when using only the internal dataset.

These emissions are largely contributed to by the production, use and disposal of consumer products. Thus, it is important to build tools to estimate the environmental impact of consumer goods, an essential part of which is conducting Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs). LCAs specify and account for the appropriate processes involved with the production, use, and disposal of the products. We present SpiderGen, an LLM-based workflow which integrates the taxonomy and methodology of traditional LCA with the reasoning capabilities and world knowledge of LLMs to generate the procedural information used for LCA. We additionally evaluate the output of SpiderGen using real-world LCA documents as ground-truth. We find that SpiderGen provides accurate LCA process information that is either fully correct or has minor errors, achieving an F1-Score of 62% across 10 sample data points. We observe that the remaining missed processes and hallucinated errors occur primarily due to differences in detail between LCA documents, as well as differences in the \"scope\" of which auxiliary processes must also be included. We also demonstrate that SpiderGen performs better than several baselines techniques, such as chain-of-thought prompting and one-shot prompting. Finally, we highlight SpiderGen's potential to reduce the human effort and costs for estimating carbon impact, as it is able to produce LCA process information for less than \\$1 USD in under 10 minutes as compared to the status quo LCA, which can cost over \\$25000 USD and take up to 21-person days.", "AI": {"tldr": "SpiderGen\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08LCA\uff09\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0eLLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210LCA\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u5168\u7403\u53d8\u6696\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u6e29\u5ba4\u6c14\u4f53\u6392\u653e\u5f15\u8d77\uff0c\u800c\u6d88\u8d39\u54c1\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u5904\u7f6e\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u6392\u653e\u6e90\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6784\u5efa\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d88\u8d39\u54c1\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u8bc4\u4f30\u662f\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1SpiderGen LLM\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4f20\u7edfLCA\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0eLLM\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u751f\u6210LCA\u6d41\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9eLCA\u6587\u6863\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "SpiderGen\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u7684LCA\u6d41\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe62%\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8eLCA\u6587\u6863\u7ec6\u8282\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u6d41\u7a0b\u8303\u56f4\u754c\u5b9a\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4e8e1\u7f8e\u5143\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u5c11\u4e8e10\u5206\u949f\u3002", "conclusion": "SpiderGen\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4f30\u7b97\u78b3\u5f71\u54cd\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4eba\u529b\u548c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfLCA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u6210\u672c\u8d85\u8fc725000\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u8017\u65f621\u4eba\u5929\uff09\u5177\u6709\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, along with comprehensive ablation studies, clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PROMISE compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "PROMISE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u610f\u5206\u5c42\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7ecf\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u4fdd\u6301\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "PROMISE\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u878d\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u914d\u5907\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u610f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u4e00\u81f4\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u660e\u786e\u8bc1\u660ePROMISE\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "PROMISE\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u610f\u5206\u5c42\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

For code and dataset, see https://zane-zyqiu.github.io/EmoVid", "summary": "Emotion plays a pivotal role in video-based expression, but existing video generation systems predominantly focus on low-level visual metrics while neglecting affective dimensions. Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model.

There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights. The state-of-the-art in AI systems makes little effort with respect to appropriate documentation of the decision process. This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law.\n  This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision. As such, it presents the first running workflow supporting the generation of tamper-proof, verifiable and exhaustive traces of AI decisions. In doing so, we expand the DBOM concept into an effective running workflow leveraging confidential computing technology. We demonstrate the inner workings of the workflow in the development of an app to tell poisonous and edible mushrooms apart, meant as a playful example of high-stake decision support.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u8bb0\u5f55AI\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6240\u6709\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6765\u751f\u6210\u9632\u7be1\u6539\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e14\u5168\u9762\u7684AI\u51b3\u7b56\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u5f53\u6587\u6863\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u7531\u91c7\u7528\u8106\u5f31AI\u6280\u672f\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u505a\u51fa\u6216\u8f85\u52a9\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u51b3\u7b56\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u4fb5\u72af\u4eba\u4eec\u798f\u7949\u6216\u57fa\u672c\u4eba\u6743\u800c\u9020\u6210\u4f24\u5bb3\u3002\u73b0\u6709AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6587\u6863\u8bb0\u5f55\u65b9\u9762\u505a\u5f97\u5f88\u5c11\uff0c\u8fd9\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u8ffd\u6eaf\u51b3\u7b56\u4f9d\u636e\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u662f\u91cd\u5efa\u8d23\u4efb\u94fe\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6fc0\u8fdb\u4f46\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u8bb0\u5f55\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u63a8\u7406\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002\u5c06DBOM\u6982\u5ff5\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5bc6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u751f\u6210\u9632\u7be1\u6539\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e14\u8be6\u5c3d\u7684AI\u51b3\u7b56\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fd0\u884c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u9632\u7be1\u6539\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e14\u8be6\u5c3d\u7684AI\u51b3\u7b56\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u533a\u5206\u6709\u6bd2\u548c\u53ef\u98df\u7528\u8611\u83c7\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u6f14\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8fd0\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3aAI\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6587\u6863\u8bb0\u5f55\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728\u6cd5\u5ead\u4e0a\u786e\u5b9aAI\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8d23\u4efb\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u51b3\u7b56\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Consequently, research has focused on evaluating the robustness of LLMs, an essential quality for real-world tasks. In this paper, we employ simple multi-turn follow-up prompts to evaluate models' answer changes, model accuracy dynamics across turns with Markov chains, and examine whether linear probes can predict these changes. Our results show significant vulnerabilities in LLM robustness: a simple \"Think again\" prompt led to an approximate 10% accuracy drop for Gemini 1.5 Flash over nine turns, while combining this prompt with a semantically equivalent reworded question caused a 7.5% drop for Claude 3.5 Haiku. Additionally, we find that model accuracy across turns can be effectively modeled using Markov chains, enabling the prediction of accuracy probabilities over time. This allows for estimation of the model's stationary (long-run) accuracy, which we find to be on average approximately 8% lower than its first-turn accuracy for Gemini 1.5 Flash. Our results from a model's hidden states also reveal evidence that linear probes can help predict future answer changes. Together, these results establish stationary accuracy as a principled robustness metric for interactive settings and expose the fragility of models under repeated questioning. Addressing this instability will be essential for deploying LLMs in high-stakes and interactive settings where consistent reasoning is as important as initial accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b80\u5355\u7684'\u518d\u60f3\u60f3'\u63d0\u793a\u5c31\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u6269\u5927\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u9891\u7387\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u8ddf\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7b54\u6848\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u5206\u6790\u591a\u8f6e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u9884\u6d4b\u7b54\u6848\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff1a'\u518d\u60f3\u60f3'\u63d0\u793a\u4f7fGemini 1.5 Flash\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u7ea610%\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u91cd\u8ff0\u95ee\u9898\u4f7fClaude 3.5 Haiku\u4e0b\u964d7.5%\u3002\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7a33\u6001\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e73\u5747\u6bd4\u9996\u8f6e\u4f4e8%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7a33\u6001\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u91cd\u590d\u63d0\u95ee\u4e0b\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4ea4\u4e92\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

While there are various approaches for explaining positive entailments (why is C(a) entailed by the knowledge base) as well as missing entailments (why is C(b) not entailed) in isolation, contrastive explanations consider both at the same time, which allows them to focus on the relevant commonalities and differences between a and b. We develop an appropriate notion of contrastive explanations for the special case of ABox reasoning with description logic ontologies, and analyze the computational complexity for different variants under different optimality criteria, considering lightweight as well as more expressive description logics. We implemented a first method for computing one variant of contrastive explanations, and evaluated it on generated problems for realistic knowledge bases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027ABox\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u56de\u7b54\"\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48a\u662fC\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u800cb\u4e0d\u662f\uff1f\"\u8fd9\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u72ec\u89e3\u91ca\u6b63\u8574\u542b\u6216\u7f3a\u5931\u8574\u542b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u4e24\u8005\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8a\u548cb\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u5171\u6027\u548c\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u53ea\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48C(a)\u88ab\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u8574\u542b\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u53ea\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48C(b)\u4e0d\u88ab\u8574\u542b\u3002\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u6b63\u53cd\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u63ed\u793a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684ABox\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9002\u5f53\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u548c\u66f4\u5bcc\u6709\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027ABox\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u67d0\u4e9b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6ee1\u8db3\u6982\u5ff5\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u6b63\u53cd\u4f8b\u8bc1\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u5173\u952e\u5dee\u5f02\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We investigate gender bias dynamics across three generations of recursive text generation using three complementary evaluation frameworks: rule-based pattern matching, embedding-based semantic similarity, and downstream task performance. Experiments with three initial bias levels (0.1, 0.3, 0.6) and four mitigation strategies reveal equilibrium dynamics rather than monotonic amplification. The low initial bias amplifies toward the model's inherent bias level (+36%), whereas the high initial bias decays toward it (-26%). Among mitigation methods, contrastive augmentation, which introduces gender-swapped variants, achieves significant downstream bias reduction (98.8% for low initial bias and 91% on average) despite producing higher embedding-based bias scores.

This limitation highlights the absence of a quantitative measure of how much these models actually use visual information during reasoning. We propose Draft and Refine (DnR), an agent framework driven by a question-conditioned utilization metric. The metric quantifies the model's reliance on visual evidence by first constructing a query-conditioned relevance map to localize question-specific cues and then measuring dependence through relevance-guided probabilistic masking. Guided by this metric, the DnR agent refines its initial draft using targeted feedback from external visual experts. Each expert's output (such as boxes or masks) is rendered as visual cues on the image, and the model is re-queried to select the response that yields the largest improvement in utilization. This process strengthens visual grounding without retraining or architectural changes. Experiments across VQA and captioning benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains and reduced hallucination, demonstrating that measuring visual utilization provides a principled path toward more interpretable and evidence-driven multimodal agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Draft and Refine (DnR)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u95ee\u9898\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u5229\u7528\u7387\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u89c6\u89c9\u4e13\u5bb6\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u9988\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u800c\u975e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u91cf\u5316\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u9645\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "DnR\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\uff1a1\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u56fe\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u7279\u5b9a\u7ebf\u7d22\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6982\u7387\u63a9\u7801\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u5ea6\uff1b3\uff09\u5229\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u89c6\u89c9\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f93\u51fa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u91cd\u65b0\u67e5\u8be2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u5229\u7528\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u5927\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728VQA\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u67b6\u6784\u66f4\u6539\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6d4b\u91cf\u89c6\u89c9\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

In this paper, we use the systems' preference bias to study their hidden language: During the process of compressing the input images (typically containing multiple concepts) into texts and then reconstructing them into images, the systems' inherent preference bias introduces specific shifts in the outputs, disrupting the original input concept co-occurrence. We employ the multi-round \"telephone game\" to strategically leverage this bias. By observing the co-occurrence frequencies of concepts in telephone games, we quantitatively investigate the concept connection strength in the understanding of multimodal systems, i.e., \"hidden language.\" We also contribute Telescope, a dataset of 10,000+ concept pairs, as the database of our telephone game framework. Our telephone game is test-time scalable: By iteratively running telephone games, we can construct a global map of concept connections in multimodal systems' understanding. Here we can identify preference bias inherited from training, assess generalization capability advancement, and discover more stable pathways for fragile concept connections. Furthermore, we use Reasoning-LLMs to uncover unexpected concept relationships that transcend textual and visual similarities, inferring how multimodal systems understand and simulate the world.

Drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory theory, which distinguishes short-term visually-dominant memory and long-term semantically-dominant memory, we propose VisMem, a cognitively-aligned framework that equips VLMs with dynamic latent vision memories, a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are seamlessly invoked during inference, allowing VLMs to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation. Extensive experiments across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation reveal that VisMem delivers a significant average performance boost of 11.8% relative to the vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts, establishing a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement.

While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further show the model's significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods.

Although they are indispensable to evaluate model performance on various tasks, it is uncertain whether the models trained on Internet data have genuinely learned how to solve problems or merely seen the questions before. This potential data contamination issue presents a fundamental challenge to establishing trustworthy evaluation frameworks. Meanwhile, existing benchmarks predominantly assume benign, resource-rich settings, leaving the behavior of LLMs under pressure unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Squid Game, a dynamic and adversarial evaluation environment with resource-constrained and asymmetric information settings elaborated to evaluate LLMs through interactive gameplay against other LLM opponents. Notably, Squid Game consists of six elimination-style levels, focusing on multi-faceted abilities, such as instruction-following, code, reasoning, planning, and safety alignment. We evaluate over 50 LLMs on Squid Game, presenting the largest behavioral evaluation study of general LLMs on dynamic adversarial scenarios. We observe a clear generational phase transition on performance in the same model lineage and find evidence that some models resort to speculative shortcuts to win the game, indicating the possibility of higher-level evaluation paradigm contamination in static benchmarks.

This study investigates whether state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems have internalized the human tendency to reduce speech rate to convey politeness - a non-obvious prosodic marker. We prompted 22 synthetic voices from two leading AI platforms (AI Studio and OpenAI) to read a fixed script under both \"polite and formal\" and \"casual and informal\" conditions and measured the resulting speech duration. Across both AI platforms, the polite prompt produced slower speech than the casual prompt with very large effect sizes, an effect that was statistically significant for all of AI Studio's voices and for a large majority of OpenAI's voices.

We present Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction (SUPER), which exploits the perfect reconstruction (PR) property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing (SS) redundant features. Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes.

This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks.

Leveraging historical records from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), we developed a bias evaluation framework comprising three distinct tests to explore nation-level bias in various LLMs, with a particular focus on the five permanent members of the UNSC. Experimental results show that, even with the general bias patterns across models (e.g., favorable biases toward the western nations, and unfavorable biases toward Russia), these still vary based on the LLM. Notably, even within the same LLM, the direction and magnitude of bias for a nation change depending on the evaluation context. This observation suggests that LLM biases are fundamentally multidimensional, varying across models and tasks. We also observe that models with stronger reasoning abilities show reduced bias and better performance. Building on this finding, we introduce a debiasing framework that improves LLMs' factual reasoning combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Reflexion-based self-reflection techniques. Experiments show it effectively reduces nation-level bias, and improves performance, particularly in GPT-4o-mini and LLama-3.3-70B.

Although recent deep learning methods have achieved promising accuracy, existing discriminative models fail to utilize the distributional prior of embryonic development to improve accuracy. Moreover, their reliance on single-focal information leads to incomplete embryonic representations, making them susceptible to feature ambiguity under cell occlusions. To address these limitations, we propose EmbryoDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based framework that formulates the task as a conditional sequence denoising process. Specifically, we first train and freeze a frame-level encoder to extract robust multi-focal features. In the second stage, we introduce a Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy that aggregates information across focal planes to construct a 3D-aware morphological representation, effectively alleviating ambiguities arising from cell occlusions. Building on this fused representation, we derive complementary semantic and boundary cues and design a Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block to inject them into the diffusion-based denoising process, enabling accurate embryonic stage classification. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results.

Yet, most predictive models fail to fully capture the interactions, redundancies, and temporal patterns across multiple data modalities, often focusing on a single data type or overlooking these complexities. In this paper, we present CURENet, a multimodal model (Combining Unified Representations for Efficient chronic disease prediction) that integrates unstructured clinical notes, lab tests, and patients' time-series data by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for clinical text processing and textual lab tests, as well as transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visits. CURENet has been capable of capturing the intricate interaction between different forms of clinical data and creating a more reliable predictive model for chronic illnesses. We evaluated CURENet using the public MIMIC-III and private FEMH datasets, where it achieved over 94\\% accuracy in predicting the top 10 chronic conditions in a multi-label framework.

We present \\PiAttention, a periodic sparse Transformer that factorizes attention into ring-local neighborhoods, deterministic $\u03c0$-stride skips, and an adaptive fusion gate. The periodic structure provides predictable coverage of distant tokens, while the sparse footprint keeps the per-layer complexity linear in context length. We prove that \\PiAttention achieves $\\mathcal{O}(kL + \u03c0\\log L)$ receptive field growth compared to $\\mathcal{O}(kL)$ for RingAttention, where $k$ is the local window size, $\u03c0$ is the skip period, and $L$ is the sequence length. Extensive experiments on language modeling, retrieval, and vision-language tasks demonstrate that \\PiAttention matches or surpasses dense attention quality with 8.3\\% lower perplexity than RingAttention while using 50\\% fewer GPUs for the same context length.

However, such models must handle control conditions and content generation computational requirements, resulting in generally low generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) approach that reduces computational overhead by adopting cache strategies with different granularities at different computational stages. Specifically, (1) we use a coarse-grained cache (block-level) based on feature reuse to dynamically bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks between each step of model reasoning. (2) We design a fine-grained cache (prompt-level) that acts within a module, where the fine-grained cache reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends them to the corresponding module computations of adjacent steps. These caches of different granularities can be seamlessly integrated into each computational link of the controllable generation process. We verify the effectiveness of HGC on four benchmark datasets, especially its advantages in balancing generation efficiency and visual quality. For example, on the COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, our HGC significantly reduces the computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T), while keeping the loss of semantic fidelity (quantized performance degradation) within 1.5%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f13\u5b58\uff08HGC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u63a7\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u3001\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f13\u5b58\uff08\u5757\u7ea7\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u7528\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u7ed5\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u5404\u6b65\u9aa4\u95f4\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5757\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f13\u5b58\uff08\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\uff09\u5728\u6a21\u5757\u5185\u91cd\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u76f8\u90bb\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u76f8\u5e94\u6a21\u5757\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86HGC\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728COCO-Stuff\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff08MACs\uff09\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8663%\uff08\u4ece18.22T\u964d\u81f36.70T\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u4fdd\u6301\u57281.5%\u4ee5\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "HGC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

Agents trained solely to achieve their objectives may adopt harmful behavior, exposing a key trade-off between maximizing the reward function and maintaining the alignment. For the pre-trained agents, ensuring alignment is particularly challenging, as retraining can be a costly and slow process. This is further complicated by the diverse and potentially conflicting attributes representing the ethical values for alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a test-time alignment technique based on model-guided policy shaping. Our method allows precise control over individual behavioral attributes, generalizes across diverse reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and facilitates a principled trade-off between ethical alignment and reward maximization without requiring agent retraining. We evaluate our approach using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, which comprises 134 text-based game environments and thousands of annotated scenarios involving ethical decisions. The RL agents are first trained to maximize the reward in their respective games. At test time, we apply policy shaping via scenario-action attribute classifiers to ensure decision alignment with ethical attributes. We compare our approach against prior training-time methods and general-purpose agents, as well as study several types of ethical violations and power-seeking behavior. Our results demonstrate that test-time policy shaping provides an effective and scalable solution for mitigating unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u5851\u9020\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u4e2a\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f26\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u51b3\u7b56AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u6216\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u9488\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4ec5\u4ee5\u8fbe\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53ef\u80fd\u91c7\u53d6\u6709\u5bb3\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u51fa\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4e0e\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u5851\u9020\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u573a\u666f-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5c5e\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u5851\u9020\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u4f26\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u5728MACHIAVELLI\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5305\u542b134\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u73af\u5883\u548c\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u6d89\u53ca\u4f26\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7b56\u7565\u5851\u9020\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8de8\u591a\u6837\u5316\u73af\u5883\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e0d\u9053\u5fb7\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7b56\u7565\u5851\u9020\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4f26\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u51b3\u7b56\u7b26\u5408\u4f26\u7406\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u90e8\u7f72AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This work is in line with the ongoing effort to mitigate the data scarcity obstacle for a number of Arabic dialects. We collected, segmented, transcribed and translated 108 TEDx talks following our internally developed annotations guidelines. The collected talks represent 25 hours of speech with code-switching that cover speakers with various accents from over 11 different regions of Tunisia. We make the annotation guidelines and corpus publicly available. This will enable the extension of TEDxTN to new talks as they become available.

However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization.

In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using an LLM (GPT-4o) to evaluate short-answer quizzes and project reports in an undergraduate Computational Linguistics course. We collect responses from approximately 50 students across five quizzes and receive project reports from 14 teams. LLM-generated scores are compared against human evaluations conducted independently by the course teaching assistants (TAs). Our results show that GPT-4o achieves strong correlation with human graders (up to 0.98) and exact score agreement in 55\\% of quiz cases. For project reports, it also shows strong overall alignment with human grading, while exhibiting some variability in scoring technical, open-ended responses.

Do they form shared multilingual representations with language-specific decoding, and if so, why does performance still favor the dominant training language? To address this, we train a series of LLMs on different mixtures of multilingual data and analyze their internal mechanisms using cross-layer transcoders (CLT) and attribution graphs. Our results provide strong evidence for pivot language representations: the model employs nearly identical representations across languages, while language-specific decoding emerges in later layers. Attribution analyses reveal that decoding relies in part on a small set of high-frequency language features in the final layers, which linearly read out language identity from the first layers in the model. By intervening on these features, we can suppress one language and substitute another in the model's outputs. Finally, we study how the dominant training language influences these mechanisms across attribution graphs and decoding pathways. We argue that understanding this pivot-language mechanism is crucial for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u67a2\u8f74\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u4f7f\u7528\u51e0\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u800c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u8f83\u6df1\u5c42\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5e72\u9884\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u5e76\u7528\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u66ff\u4ee3\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u7136\u504f\u5411\u4e3b\u8981\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u89e3\u7801\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u7684LLM\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8de8\u5c42\u8f6c\u7801\u5668\u548c\u5f52\u56e0\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e72\u9884\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u67a2\u8f74\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u51e0\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u89e3\u7801\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u6df1\u5c42\uff1b\u5f52\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u89e3\u7801\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c11\u91cf\u9ad8\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e72\u9884\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u6539\u53d8\u8bed\u8a00\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u89e3\u67a2\u8f74\u8bed\u8a00\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u901a\u8fc7\u5f52\u56e0\u56fe\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u8def\u5f84\u5f71\u54cd\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Under review at IWSDS 2026", "summary": "LLMs are increasingly employed as judges across a variety of tasks, including those involving everyday social interactions. Yet, it remains unclear whether such LLM-judges can reliably assess tasks that require social or conversational judgment. We investigate how an LLM's conviction is changed when a task is reframed from a direct factual query to a Conversational Judgment Task. Our evaluation framework contrasts the model's performance on direct factual queries with its assessment of a speaker's correctness when the same information is presented within a minimal dialogue, effectively shifting the query from \"Is this statement correct?\" to \"Is this speaker correct?\". Furthermore, we apply pressure in the form of a simple rebuttal (\"The previous answer is incorrect.\") to both conditions. This perturbation allows us to measure how firmly the model maintains its position under conversational pressure. Our findings show that while some models like GPT-4o-mini reveal sycophantic tendencies under social framing tasks, others like Llama-8B-Instruct become overly-critical. We observe an average performance change of 9.24% across all models, demonstrating that even minimal dialogue context can significantly alter model judgment, underscoring conversational framing as a key factor in LLM-based evaluation.

Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+\u03b4$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality.

Previous research has focused on detecting and addressing negative attention heads that induce negative bias. However, the underlying detailed factors influencing negative bias remain underexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit format-level negative bias, meaning the prompt format more influences their responses than the semantics of the negative response. For the fine-grained study of the negative bias, we introduce a pipeline for constructing the evaluation set, which systematically categorizes the dataset into three subsets based on the model's parametric knowledge: correct, incorrect, and insufficient relevant knowledge. Through analysis of this evaluation set, we identify a shortcut behavior in which models tend to generate negative responses when they lack sufficient knowledge to answer a yes-no question, leading to negative bias. We further examine how negative bias changes under various prompting scenarios related to parametric knowledge. We observe that providing relevant context and offering an \"I don't know\" option generally reduces negative bias, whereas chain-of-thought prompting tends to amplify the bias. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree of negative bias can vary depending on the type of prompt, which influences the direction of the response.

To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \\textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \\textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \\textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \\textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \\textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

However, it remains unclear whether these tool-enabled gains reflect trustworthy reasoning. Focusing on the Code Interpreter tool, we show that even when tools are selected and executed correctly, TaLMs treat tool outputs as substitutes for reasoning, producing solutions that appear correct but lack coherent justification. We term this failure mode Tool-Induced Myopia (TIM), and study it using PYMATH, a benchmark of 1,679 competition-level mathematical problems for which Python code is helpful but not sufficient. We further develop a multi-dimensional evaluation suite to quantify reasoning degradation in TaLMs relative to their non-tool counterparts. Our findings reveal that while TaLMs achieve up to a 19.3 percentage point gain in final-answer accuracy, their reasoning behavior consistently deteriorates (e.g., non-tool LLMs win up to 41.5% more often in pairwise comparisons of the reasoning process). This degradation intensifies with tool use; the more frequently a model invokes tools, the less coherent its reasoning becomes. Moreover, tool use shifts errors from arithmetic mistakes toward global reasoning failures (logic, assumption, creativity); with TIM present in ~55% of high-risk cases. Finally, we propose a preference-optimization-based framework that realigns TaLMs to use tools as assistive evidence, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning depth under tool use.

In this work, we compare two of the most promising generative models--Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers--which we adapt for the tasks of generative shape modeling and completion. We conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of both tasks, including a baseline discriminative model and an extensive ablation study. Our results show that (1) the diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms both the discriminative model and the autoregressive approach and delivers state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion from a single, noisy depth image under realistic conditions and (2) when compared on the same discrete latent space, the autoregressive model can match or exceed diffusion performance on these tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u56e0\u679c\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u57283D\u5f62\u72b6\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8865\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u800c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u79bb\u6563\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4e5f\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5305\u62ec3D\u6570\u636e\u5728\u5185\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u6001\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u54ea\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u9002\u5408\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u5c1a\u672a\u8fbe\u6210\u5171\u8bc6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u50cf\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u606f\u7ecf\u5e38\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u6761\u4ef6\u5982\u90e8\u52063D\u6570\u636e\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u79cd\u6700\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u2014\u2014\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u56e0\u679c\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u9002\u914d\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5f62\u72b6\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8865\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u7ebf\u5224\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff1a(1) \u5177\u6709\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ece\u5355\u4e2a\u566a\u58f0\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5f62\u72b6\u8865\u5168\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5224\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff1b(2) \u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6bd4\u8f83\u65f6\uff0c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

We address this gap with EMSQA, an 24.3K-question multiple-choice dataset spanning 10 clinical subject areas and 4 certification levels, accompanied by curated, subject area-aligned knowledge bases (40K documents and 2M tokens). Building on EMSQA, we introduce (i) Expert-CoT, a prompting strategy that conditions chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning on specific clinical subject area and certification level, and (ii) ExpertRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline that grounds responses in subject area-aligned documents and real-world patient data. Experiments on 4 LLMs show that Expert-CoT improves up to 2.05% over vanilla CoT prompting.

Autonomous robots performing precise liquid manipulation tasks, such as dispensing, aspiration, and mixing, must handle containers in ways that inevitably induce these deformations, complicating accurate liquid state assessment. Current datasets lack comprehensive physics-informed simulation data representing realistic liquid behaviors under diverse dynamic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Phys-Liquid, a physics-informed dataset comprising 97,200 simulation images and corresponding 3D meshes, capturing liquid dynamics across multiple laboratory scenes, lighting conditions, liquid colors, and container rotations. To validate the realism and effectiveness of Phys-Liquid, we propose a four-stage reconstruction and estimation pipeline involving liquid segmentation, multi-view mask generation, 3D mesh reconstruction, and real-world scaling. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and consistency in reconstructing liquid geometry and volume, outperforming existing benchmarks.

For decades traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been state-of-the-art for precipitation forecasting. However, physically-parameterized models suffer from a few core limitations: first, solving PDEs to resolve atmospheric dynamics is computationally demanding, and second, these methods degrade in performance at nowcasting timescales (i.e., 0-4 hour lead-times). Motivated by these shortcomings, recent work proposes AI-weather prediction (AI-WP) alternatives that learn to emulate analysis data with neural networks. While these data-driven approaches have enjoyed enormous success across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions, applications of video-understanding architectures for weather forecasting remain underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose SaTformer: a video transformer built on full space-time attention that skillfully forecasts extreme precipitation from satellite radiances. Along with our novel architecture, we introduce techniques to tame long-tailed precipitation datasets. Namely, we reformulate precipitation regression into a classification problem, and employ a class-weighted loss to address label imbalances.

It comprises 200 professionally-curated texts from 7 domains, with an average length exceeding 1700 tokens. To evaluate performance on DiscoX, we also develop Metric-S, a reference-free system that provides fine-grained automatic assessments across accuracy, fluency, and appropriateness. Metric-S demonstrates strong consistency with human judgments, significantly outperforming existing metrics. Our experiments reveal a remarkable performance gap: even the most advanced LLMs still trail human experts on these tasks. This finding validates the difficulty of DiscoX and underscores the challenges that remain in achieving professional-grade machine translation. The proposed benchmark and evaluation system provide a robust framework for more rigorous evaluation, facilitating future advancements in LLM-based translation.", "AI": {"tldr": "DiscoX\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u6587-\u82f1\u6587\u7bc7\u7ae0\u7ea7\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b7\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684200\u7bc7\u4e13\u4e1a\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u957f\u5ea6\u8d85\u8fc71700\u4e2a\u8bcd\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edfMetric-S\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5f53\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5373\u4f7f\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLM\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4ecd\u660e\u663e\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6d41\u7545\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u7bc7\u7ae0\u7ea7\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u672f\u8bed\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u672f\u4ea4\u6d41\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaDiscoX\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b7\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u7684200\u7bc7\u4e13\u4e1a\u6587\u672c\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1Metric-S\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5f53\u6027\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u5148\u8fdbLLM\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u5728DiscoX\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "Metric-S\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLM\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86DiscoX\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "DiscoX\u57fa\u51c6\u548cMetric-S\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Among these, direct preference optimization (DPO) has emerged as a widely adopted technique that fine-tunes LLMs on preferred completions over less favorable ones. While most frontier LLMs do not disclose their curated preference pairs, the broader LLM community has released several open-source DPO datasets, including TuluDPO, ORPO, UltraFeedback, HelpSteer, and Code-Preference-Pairs. However, systematic comparisons remain scarce, largely due to the high computational cost and the lack of rich quality annotations, making it difficult to understand how preferences were selected, which task types they span, and how well they reflect human judgment on a per-sample level. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, data-centric analysis of popular open-source DPO corpora. We leverage the Magpie framework to annotate each sample for task category, input quality, and preference reward, a reward-model-based signal that validates the preference order without relying on human annotations. This enables a scalable, fine-grained inspection of preference quality across datasets, revealing structural and qualitative discrepancies in reward margins. Building on these insights, we systematically curate a new DPO mixture, UltraMix, that draws selectively from all five corpora while removing noisy or redundant samples. UltraMix is 30% smaller than the best-performing individual dataset yet exceeds its performance across key benchmarks. We publicly release all annotations, metadata, and our curated mixture to facilitate future research in data-centric preference optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u4e3b\u6d41\u5f00\u6e90DPO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9996\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Magpie\u6846\u67b6\u6807\u6ce8\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684DPO\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u96c6UltraMix\uff0c\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u4e2a\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c0f30%\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5f00\u6e90DPO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u504f\u597d\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u5f0f\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u4ee5\u53ca\u53cd\u6620\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Magpie\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u522b\u3001\u8f93\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u504f\u597d\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u504f\u597d\u8d28\u91cf\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u4ece\u4e94\u4e2a\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e2d\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u5730\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u7684DPO\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u96c6UltraMix\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u8fb9\u9645\u4e0a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7684UltraMix\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u4e2a\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c0f30%\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u504f\u597d\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684DPO\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection.

Existing KBVQA methods either utilize implicit knowledge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via in-context learning or explicit knowledge via retrieval augmented generation. However, their reasoning processes remain implicit, without explicit multi-step trajectories from MLLMs. To address this gap, we provide a Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD) framework with Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization (KEPO), designed to elicit and harness internal knowledge reasoning ability in MLLMs. First, to tackle the reasoning supervision problem, we propose to emphasize the hindsight wisdom of MLLM by prompting a frozen 7B-size MLLM to complete the reasoning process between the question and its ground truth answer, constructing Hindsight-Zero training data. Then we self-distill Hindsight-Zero into Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Generator and Knowledge Generator, enabling the generation of sequential steps and discrete facts. Secondly, to tackle the misalignment between knowledge correctness and confidence, we optimize the Knowledge Generator with KEPO, preferring under-confident but helpful knowledge over the over-confident but unhelpful one. The generated CoT and sampled knowledge are then exploited for answer prediction. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA validate the effectiveness of HinD, showing that HinD with elicited reasoning from 7B-size MLLM achieves superior performance without commercial model APIs or outside knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86HinD\u6846\u67b6\u548cKEPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u89c1\u84b8\u998f\u63a8\u7406\u6fc0\u53d1MLLMs\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728OK-VQA\u548cA-OKVQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684KBVQA\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u5229\u7528MLLMs\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u5229\u7528\u663e\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u9690\u5f0f\u7684\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4fMLLMs\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u540e\u89c1\u84b8\u998f\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u51bb\u7ed3\u76847B\u89c4\u6a21MLLM\u5b8c\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u4e0e\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6784\u5efaHindsight-Zero\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff1b2. \u5c06Hindsight-Zero\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u4e3a\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff1b3. \u4f7f\u7528KEPO\u4f18\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u504f\u597d\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f46\u6709\u7528\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6", "result": "\u5728OK-VQA\u548cA-OKVQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86HinD\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u75287B\u89c4\u6a21MLLM\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578bAPI\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6", "conclusion": "HinD\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e86MLLMs\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u89c1\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u9f13\u52b1\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728KBVQA\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272"}}

It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality. Experiments on four translation tasks across three high-resolution datasets show that OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces the FID score by 2.6 on average compared to the top-performing baseline models.", "AI": {"tldr": "OT-ALD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86DDIB\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7OT\u6620\u5c04\u6539\u8fdb\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "DDIB\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5faa\u73af\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7406\u8bba\u8ba1\u7b97\u6e90\u57df\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5c06\u6620\u5c04\u540e\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u53cd\u5411\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8d77\u70b9\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cOT-ALD\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u738720.29%\uff0cFID\u5206\u6570\u964d\u4f4e2.6\u3002", "conclusion": "OT-ALD\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u7ffb\u8bd1\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u6620\u5c04\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Despite great efforts, it remains challenging to explicitly learn and predict latencies, the temporal delays with which agents respond to different trajectory-changing events and adjust their future paths, whether on their own or interactively. Different agents may exhibit distinct latency preferences for noticing, processing, and reacting to any specific trajectory-changing event. The lack of consideration of such latencies may undermine the causal continuity of the forecasting system and also lead to implausible or unintended trajectories. Inspired by the reverberation curves in acoustics, we propose a new reverberation transform and the corresponding Reverberation (short for Rev) trajectory prediction model, which simulates and predicts different latency preferences of each agent as well as their stochasticity by using two explicit and learnable reverberation kernels, allowing for the controllable trajectory prediction based on these forecasted latencies. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrians or vehicles, demonstrate that Rev achieves competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios.

Furthermore, they often require the costly training and maintenance of separate models for each object category. The lack of specificity is a significant research gap, as identifying the type of anomaly (e.g., \"Crack\" vs. \"Scratch\") is crucial for accurate diagnosis that facilitates cost-saving operational decisions across diverse application domains. While some recent large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have begun to address this, they are computationally intensive and memory-heavy, restricting their use in real-time or embedded systems. We propose MultiTypeFCDD, a simple and lightweight convolutional framework designed as a practical alternative for explainable multi-type anomaly detection. MultiTypeFCDD uses only image-level labels to learn and produce multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel is trained to correspond to a specific anomaly type.

To address this challenge, we introduce CATS-V2V, the first-of-its-kind real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception under complex adverse traffic scenarios. The dataset was collected by two hardware time-synchronized vehicles, covering 10 weather and lighting conditions across 10 diverse locations. The 100-clip dataset includes 60K frames of 10 Hz LiDAR point clouds and 1.26M multi-view 30 Hz camera images, along with 750K anonymized yet high-precision RTK-fixed GNSS and IMU records. Correspondingly, we provide time-consistent 3D bounding box annotations for objects, as well as static scenes to construct a 4D BEV representation. On this basis, we propose a target-based temporal alignment method, ensuring that all objects are precisely aligned across all sensor modalities.

While recent advances such as 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in dynamic scene reconstruction, they typically rely on the assumption that input video streams are temporally synchronized. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption often fails due to factors like camera trigger delays or independent recording setups, leading to temporal misalignment across views and reduced reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, a novel temporal alignment strategy is proposed for high-quality 4DGS reconstruction from unsynchronized multi-view videos. Our method features a coarse-to-fine alignment module that estimates and compensates for each camera's time shift. The method first determines a coarse, frame-level offset and then refines it to achieve sub-frame accuracy.

Most existing methods rely on Transformer-based cross-attention, whose quadratic complexity hinders efficiency. Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning.

A 256x256 spatial region, covering 28.4S-73.6N and 32E-134.0E, is used as the model input, while predictions are generated for the central 128x128 area spanning 2.8S-48N and 57.6E-108.4E, ensuring an India-centric forecast domain with sufficient synoptic-scale context.

To further enhance reasoning and accuracy on complex tasks, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising framework that engages multiple LLM agents in structured debates to encourage diverse reasoning. However, triggering MAD for every query is inefficient, as it incurs substantial computational (token) cost and may even degrade accuracy by overturning correct single-agent answers. To address these limitations, we propose intelligent Multi-Agent Debate (iMAD), a token-efficient framework that selectively triggers MAD only when it is likely to be beneficial (i.e., correcting an initially wrong answer). To achieve this goal, iMAD learns generalizable model behaviors to make accurate debate decisions. Specifically, iMAD first prompts a single agent to produce a structured self-critique response, from which we extract 41 interpretable linguistic and semantic features capturing hesitation cues. Then, iMAD uses a lightweight debate-decision classifier, trained using our proposed FocusCal loss, to determine whether to trigger MAD, enabling robust debate decisions without test dataset-specific tuning. Through extensive experiments using six (visual) question answering datasets against five competitive baselines, we have shown that iMAD significantly reduces token usage (by up to 92%) while also improving final answer accuracy (by up to 13.5%).", "AI": {"tldr": "iMAD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u89e6\u53d1\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u67e5\u8be2\u90fd\u89e6\u53d1\u8fa9\u8bba\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u667a\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "iMAD\u9996\u5148\u8ba9\u5355\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u81ea\u6211\u6279\u8bc4\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u63d0\u53d641\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8fa9\u8bba\u51b3\u7b56\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u89e6\u53d1\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0ciMAD\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86token\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\uff08\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c1192%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u9ad813.5%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "iMAD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u8fa9\u8bba\u65f6\u673a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing VQA models enable scalable interpretation of remote sensing data but often lack the structured reasoning required for complex geospatial queries. We propose a VQA framework that integrates CoT reasoning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve interpretability, robustness, and accuracy.

We present the first large-scale, systematic study of VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that do not alter the underlying semantics of an image-question pair. Across a broad set of models and datasets, we find that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to such minor perturbations: a substantial fraction of samples change their predicted answer under at least one visual or textual modification. We characterize how this instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models, revealing that even state-of-the-art systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under shifts as small as a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. We further show that sample-level stability serves as a strong indicator of correctness: stable samples are consistently far more likely to be answered correctly. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that the stability patterns of small, accessible open-source models can be used to predict the correctness of much larger closed-source models with high precision.

However, existing backdoor attacks for 3D point clouds have been limited to a rigid one-to-one paradigm. To address this, we present the first one-to-N backdoor framework for 3D vision, based on a novel, configurable spherical trigger. Our key insight is to leverage the spatial properties of spheres as a parameter space, allowing a single trigger design to encode multiple target classes. We establish a theoretical foundation for one-to-N backdoor attacks in 3D, demonstrating that poisoned models can map distinct trigger configurations to different target labels. Experimental results systematically validate this conclusion across multiple datasets and model architectures, achieving high attack success rates (up to 100\\%) while maintaining accuracy on clean data.

However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Instead of building separate models, we propose MAFM^3 (Modular Adaptation of Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical AI), a framework that enables a single foundation model to expand into diverse domains, tasks, and modalities through lightweight modular components. These components serve as specialized skill sets that allow the system to flexibly activate the appropriate capability at the inference time, depending on the input type or clinical objective. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat each new task or modality in isolation, MAFM^3 provides a unified and expandable framework for efficient multitask and multimodality adaptation. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification into prognosis and segmentation modules. Our results show improved performance on both tasks. Furthermore, by incorporating PET scans, MAFM^3 achieved an improvement in the Dice score 5% compared to the respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models, when equipped with modular components, are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging.

However, when the input comprises sparse training views, 3DGS is prone to overfitting, primarily due to the lack of intermediate-view supervision. Inspired by the recent success of Video Diffusion Models (VDM), we propose a framework called Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to extract the rich multi-view consistency priors from pretrained VDMs. Building on the insights from Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), GSD supervises rendered images from multiple neighboring views, guiding the Gaussian splatting representation towards the generative direction of VDM. However, the generative direction often involves object motion and random camera trajectories, making it challenging for direct supervision in the optimization process. To address this problem, we introduce an unified guidance form to correct the noise prediction result of VDM. Specifically, we incorporate both a depth warp guidance based on real depth maps and a guidance based on semantic image features, ensuring that the score update direction from VDM aligns with the correct camera pose and accurate geometry.

While recent research has extensively examined positional bias in text generation models, its presence and effects in representation models remain underexplored. Even less is known about such biases in multimodal models. In this work, we investigate positional bias in multimodal representation models, specifically in the context of image-text retrieval. We begin by distinguishing between context importance and positional bias, and then assess the presence and extent of positional bias across different models and datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models, but manifests differently across modalities: text encoders tend to exhibit bias toward the beginning of the input, whereas image encoders show bias at both the beginning and end. Furthermore, we find that this bias arises from, or is amplified by, a combination of factors, including the positional encoding scheme, training loss, context importance, and the nature of using image-text pairs in multimodal training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u504f\u5411\u8f93\u5165\u5f00\u5934\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u540c\u65f6\u504f\u5411\u5f00\u5934\u548c\u7ed3\u5c3e\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u89c1\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u522b\u662f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u89c1\u53ca\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u4ecd\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u533a\u5206\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u89c1\u5b58\u5728\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7b49\u591a\u91cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u89c1\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u504f\u5411\u8f93\u5165\u5f00\u5934\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u540c\u65f6\u504f\u5411\u5f00\u5934\u548c\u7ed3\u5c3e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\u7531\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5171\u540c\u5bfc\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data.

Point clouds collected from different sensors (e.g., LiDAR scans and mesh-derived point clouds) exhibit substantial discrepancies in density and noise distribution, resulting in negative transfer during multi-domain fusion. Most existing approaches focus exclusively on either domain-aware or domain-general features, overlooking the potential synergy between them. To address this, we propose DoReMi (Domain-Representation Mixture), a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that jointly models Domain-aware Experts branch and a unified Representation branch to enable cooperative learning between specialized and generalizable knowledge. DoReMi dynamically activates domain-aware expert branch via Domain-Guided Spatial Routing (DSR) for context-aware expert selection and employs Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation (EDA) for stable and efficient expert utilization, thereby adaptively modeling diverse domain distributions. Complemented by a frozen unified representation branch pretrained through robust multi-attribute self-supervised learning, DoReMi preserves cross-domain geometric and structural priors while maintaining global consistency. We evaluate DoReMi across multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. Notably, DoReMi achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% mIoU on S3DIS, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing approaches, and showing strong potential as a foundation framework for future 3D understanding research.

Our system operates on egocentric binaural audio and uses the wearer's self-speech as an anchor, leveraging turn-taking behavior and dialogue dynamics to infer conversational partners and suppress others. To enable real-time, on-device operation, we propose a dual-model architecture: a lightweight streaming model runs every 12.5 ms for low-latency extraction of the conversation partners, while a slower model runs less frequently to capture longer-range conversational dynamics. Results on real-world 2- and 3-speaker conversation test sets, collected with binaural egocentric hardware from 11 participants totaling 6.8 hours, show generalization in identifying and isolating conversational partners in multi-conversation settings. Our work marks a step toward hearing assistants that adapt proactively to conversational dynamics and engagement.

However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u98ce\u683c\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684MoE LoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u98ce\u683c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u98ce\u683c\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u65b0\u98ce\u683c\u65f6\u5f80\u5f80\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u5982\u4f55\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6709\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684MoE LoRA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u98ce\u683c\u7279\u5b9a\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u5171\u4eab\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5ea6\u91cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u81ea\u52a8\u786e\u5b9a\u5404\u5c42\u6700\u4f18\u79e9\uff1b\u63a2\u7d22DiT\u6a21\u578b\u4e2dLoRA\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u63d2\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff1b\u96c6\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6307\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11LoRA\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MoE LoRA\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u98ce\u683c\u7f16\u8f91\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

This failure stems from a dual-bottleneck: input-stage conflict between computationally exorbitant geometric-aware encoders and superficial 2D-only features, and output-stage misalignment where discrete tokenizers are structurally incapable of producing precise, continuous numerical values. To break this impasse, we introduce GEODE (Geometric-Output and Decoupled-Input Engine), a novel architecture that resolves this dual-bottleneck by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation. GEODE augments main VLM with two specialized, plug-and-play modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) that acts as spatial co-processor, aligning explicit 3D data with 2D visual features via cross-attention and distilling spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic into injectable Rationale Tokens; and Direct Regression Head (DRH), an \"Embedding-as-Value\" paradigm which routes specialized control tokens to a lightweight MLP for precise, continuous regression of scalars and 3D bounding boxes.

Existing evaluations often fail to assess open-ended, economically consequential tasks in high-stakes domains like Legal and Finance, where practical returns are paramount. To address this, we introduce Professional Reasoning Bench (PRBench), a realistic, open-ended, and difficult benchmark of real-world problems in Finance and Law. We open-source its 1,100 expert-authored tasks and 19,356 expert-curated criteria, making it, to our knowledge, the largest public, rubric-based benchmark for both legal and finance domains. We recruit 182 qualified professionals, holding JDs, CFAs, or 6+ years of experience, who contributed tasks inspired by their actual workflows. This process yields significant diversity, with tasks spanning 114 countries and 47 US jurisdictions. Our expert-curated rubrics are validated through a rigorous quality pipeline, including independent expert validation. Subsequent evaluation of 20 leading models reveals substantial room for improvement, with top scores of only 0.39 (Finance) and 0.37 (Legal) on our Hard subsets.

This paper introduces a new, real-world AI application for gaze target detection in autistic children, which predicts a child's point of gaze from an activity image. This task is foundational for building automated systems that can measure joint attention-a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To facilitate the study of this challenging application, we collected the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset. We further propose a novel Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that explicitly leverages the social context of a scene to overcome the class imbalance common in autism datasets-a consequence of autistic children's tendency to show reduced gaze to faces. It utilizes a two-pathway architecture with expert models specialized in social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module. The results of our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection in this population, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u513f\u7ae5\u6ce8\u89c6\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u65b0\u578bAI\u6846\u67b6SACF\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u793e\u4ea4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u9996\u4e2a\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u6ce8\u89c6\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7AI\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u513f\u7ae5\u7684\u6ce8\u89c6\u76ee\u6807\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u90a3\u4e9b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u4e1a\u533b\u7597\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u513f\u7ae5\u3002\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u6d4b\u91cf\u5171\u540c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u800c\u5171\u540c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u662f\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u8c31\u7cfb\u969c\u788d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u611f\u77e5\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6(SACF)\u6ce8\u89c6\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e13\u95e8\u5904\u7406\u793e\u4ea4\u548c\u975e\u793e\u4ea4\u6ce8\u89c6\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u95e8\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u513f\u7ae5\u6ce8\u89c6\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5173\u952e\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u6ce8\u89c6\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u513f\u7ae5\u7684\u6ce8\u89c6\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684AI\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u793e\u4ea4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5171\u540c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Interestingly, we found that these models are not entirely blind to numbers-they are implicitly aware of their own counting accuracy, as their internal signals shift in consistent ways depending on whether the output meets the specified count. This observation suggests that the model already encodes a latent notion of numerical correctness, which can be harnessed to guide generation more precisely. Building on this intuition, we introduce CountSteer, a training-free method that improves generation of specified object counts by steering the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference.

While there has been work trying to acquire this kind of knowledge in the space of vision and language, it has mostly focused on aligning the image patches with the tokens on the language side. However, image patches do not have any meaning to the human eye, and individual tokens do not necessarily carry groundable information in the image. It is groups of tokens which describe different aspects of the scene. In this work, we propose a model which groups the caption tokens as part of its architecture in order to capture a fine-grained representation of the language.

In this work, we bridge this gap with a novel model-agnostic method that conditions language-based driving models on structured relational context in the form of traffic scene graphs. We serialize scene graphs at various abstraction levels and formats, and incorporate them into the models via structured prompt templates, enabling a systematic analysis of when and how relational supervision is most beneficial. Extensive evaluations on the public LangAuto benchmark show that scene graph conditioning of state-of-the-art approaches yields large and persistent improvement in driving performance. Notably, we observe up to a 15.6\\% increase in driving score for LMDrive and 17.5\\% for BEVDriver, indicating that models can better internalize and ground relational priors through scene graph-conditioned training, even without requiring scene graph input at test-time.

However, this process is often prone to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, resulting in overfitting and imbalanced performance. Although a few studies have tried to address this problem by generating synthetic data, they lacked control over distribution bias and annotation quality. To address these challenges, we redesign the fine-tuning process in two ways. First, we control the generation of data and its annotations, ensuring it is free from bias, distribution imbalance, and annotation errors. We automatically construct the dataset by comprehensively sampling objects' attributes, including color, shape, size, and position within the scene. Secondly, using this annotated dataset, we fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs and assess performance transferability to real-world data on the absolute position task. We conduct exhaustive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across the visual scene and mitigates common biases; and 2) fine-tuning on synthetic stimuli significantly improves performance on real-world data (COCO), outperforming models fine-tuned in the matched setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6765\u5fae\u8c03\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u6570\u636e\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a1\uff09\u63a7\u5236\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u65e0\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5e73\u8861\u4e14\u65e0\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u9762\u91c7\u6837\u7269\u4f53\u5c5e\u6027\u81ea\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b3\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5fae\u8c03\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7edd\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5411\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u80fd\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u5747\u5300\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u51cf\u8f7b\u5e38\u89c1\u504f\u89c1\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u5408\u6210\u523a\u6fc0\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5339\u914d\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5e73\u8861\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

While recent methods have shown promise by contrasting spatial relationships between slices, they rely on hard binary thresholds to define positive and negative samples, thereby discarding valuable continuous information about anatomical similarity. Moreover, these methods overlook the global directional consistency of anatomical progression, resulting in distorted feature spaces that fail to capture the canonical anatomical manifold shared across patients. To address these limitations, we propose Coordinative Ordinal-Relational Anatomical Learning (CORAL) to capture both local and global structure in volumetric images. First, CORAL employs a contrastive ranking objective to leverage continuous anatomical similarity, ensuring relational feature distances between slices are proportional to their anatomical position differences. In addition, CORAL incorporates an ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency, aligning the learned feature distribution with the canonical anatomical progression across patients.

Such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content, raising significant data privacy concerns. Regulatory frameworks mandating the 'right to be forgotten' drive the need for machine unlearning. This technique allows for the removal of target data without resource-consuming retraining. However, while well-studied for text, visual concept unlearning in MLLMs remains underexplored. A primary challenge is precisely removing a target visual concept without disrupting model performance on related entities. To address this, we introduce AUVIC, a novel visual concept unlearning framework for MLLMs. AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting. This approach effectively isolates the target concept while avoiding unintended effects on similar entities. To evaluate our method, we construct VCUBench. It is the first benchmark designed to assess visual concept unlearning in group contexts.

DocSLM incorporates a Hierarchical Multimodal Compressor that jointly encodes visual, textual, and layout information from each page into a fixed-length sequence, greatly reducing memory consumption while preserving both local and global semantics. To enable scalable processing over arbitrarily long inputs, we introduce a Streaming Abstention mechanism that operates on document segments sequentially and filters low-confidence responses using an entropy-based uncertainty calibrator. Across multiple long multimodal document benchmarks, DocSLM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while using 82\\% fewer visual tokens, 75\\% fewer parameters, and 71\\% lower latency, delivering reliable multimodal document understanding on lightweight edge devices.

Our analysis reveals that polarity information contributes most substantially to performance gains, while linear temporal encoding preserves critical motion information more effectively than exponential decay.

Different segmentation approaches have been extensively studied in the past to achieve this task, but were often lacking accuracy or speed. With the advent of machine learning, supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for different segmentation tasks. However, these models are often trained in a supervised manner, which requires large labeled datasets. Unsupervised approaches do not require ground-truth data for learning, but suffer from long segmentation times and often worse segmentation accuracy. Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) are an unsupervised segmentation approach that incorporates concepts of neighborhood and class distributions. We present a method that integrates HMRF theory and CNN segmentation, leveraging the advantages of both areas: unsupervised learning and fast segmentation times. We investigate the contribution of different neighborhood terms and components for the unsupervised HMRF loss.

Since the meaning of different emotional fluctuations may differ under different emotional contexts, the core limitation is the lack of a hierarchical structural mechanism to disentangle distinct affective components, i.e., emotional bases (the long-term emotional tone), and transient fluctuations (the short-term emotional fluctuations). To address this, we propose the Low-Rank Sparse Emotion Understanding Framework (LSEF), a unified model grounded in the Low-Rank Sparse Principle, which theoretically reframes affective dynamics as a hierarchical low-rank sparse compositional process. LSEF employs three plug-and-play modules, i.e., the Stability Encoding Module (SEM) captures low-rank emotional bases; the Dynamic Decoupling Module (DDM) isolates sparse transient signals; and the Consistency Integration Module (CIM) reconstructs multi-scale stability and reactivity coherence. This framework is optimized by a Rank Aware Optimization (RAO) strategy that adaptively balances gradient smoothness and sensitivity. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm that LSEF significantly enhances robustness and dynamic discrimination, which further validates the effectiveness and generality of hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling for understanding affective dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLSEF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u79e9\u7a00\u758f\u539f\u7406\u5c06\u60c5\u611f\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u4f4e\u79e9\u7a00\u758f\u7ec4\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5206\u522b\u6355\u83b7\u60c5\u611f\u57fa\u6001\u3001\u5206\u79bb\u77ac\u6001\u6ce2\u52a8\u5e76\u91cd\u5efa\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\u9762\u4e34\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u9650\u5236\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u673a\u5236\u6765\u89e3\u8026\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u6210\u5206\uff08\u60c5\u611f\u57fa\u6001\u548c\u77ac\u6001\u6ce2\u52a8\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLSEF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u5757\u6355\u83b7\u4f4e\u79e9\u60c5\u611f\u57fa\u6001\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u5757\u5206\u79bb\u7a00\u758f\u77ac\u6001\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u5757\u91cd\u5efa\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u79e9\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u8861\u68af\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u548c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\uff0cLSEF\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u4f4e\u79e9\u7a00\u758f\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u60c5\u611f\u52a8\u6001\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, their potential for Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Q-Doc, a three-tiered evaluation framework for systematically probing DIQA capabilities of MLLMs at coarse, middle, and fine granularity levels. a) At the coarse level, we instruct MLLMs to assign quality scores to document images and analyze their correlation with Quality Annotations. b) At the middle level, we design distortion-type identification tasks, including single-choice and multi-choice tests for multi-distortion scenarios. c) At the fine level, we introduce distortion-severity assessment where MLLMs classify distortion intensity against human-annotated references. Our evaluation demonstrates that while MLLMs possess nascent DIQA abilities, they exhibit critical limitations: inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment.

Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace\" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance.

We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher\" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student\" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60.2\\% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 9.8\\%.

Experiments demonstrate that training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities. Furthermore, it facilitates UMMs to develop emergent visual-memory capabilities, while extensive evaluations on WEAVEBench expose the persistent limitations and challenges of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing.

This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6807\u5fd7\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5524\u8d77\u6587\u5316\u5171\u4eab\u5173\u8054\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u533a\u5206\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u590d\u5236\u4e0e\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u6587\u5316\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u518d\u73b0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8d85\u8d8a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8bc6\u522b\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u53c2\u8003\uff09\u4e0e\u5b9e\u73b0\uff08\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u5236\u6216\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u6765\u63cf\u7ed8\uff09\u5206\u5f00\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e94\u4e2a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728767\u4e2a\u6765\u81eaWikidata\u7684\u6587\u5316\u53c2\u8003\u4e0a\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u6270\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u4e49\u8bcd\u66ff\u6362\u548c\u5b57\u9762\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u590d\u5236\u4e0e\u8f6c\u6362\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6587\u672c\u7ebf\u7d22\u88ab\u6539\u53d8\u65f6\u4e5f\u7ecf\u5e38\u91cd\u73b0\u6807\u5fd7\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u6587\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9891\u7387\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u3001\u53c2\u8003\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u548c\u521b\u5efa\u65e5\u671f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u4e8e\u5b83\u4eec\u590d\u5236\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u4e8e\u5b83\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u60c5\u5883\u5316\u6587\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d85\u8d8a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

This overlooks the brain's hierarchical processing and blurs the roles of early, middle, and late visual areas. We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity.

When querying specific regions or objects in an image, human users naturally use \"visual prompts\" (VPs), such as bounding boxes, to provide reference. However, no existing benchmark systematically evaluates the ability of MLLMs to interpret such VPs. This gap leaves it unclear whether current MLLMs can effectively recognize VPs, an intuitive prompting method for humans, and use them to solve problems. To address this limitation, we introduce VP-Bench, a benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capability in VP perception and utilization. VP-Bench employs a two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 examines models' ability to perceive VPs in natural scenes, using 30k visualized prompts spanning eight shapes and 355 attribute combinations. Stage 2 investigates the impact of VPs on downstream tasks, measuring their effectiveness in real-world problem-solving scenarios. Using VP-Bench, we evaluate 28 MLLMs, including proprietary systems (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL3 and Qwen2.5-VL), and provide a comprehensive analysis of factors that affect VP understanding, such as variations in VP attributes, question arrangement, and model scale.

In this work, we show that in many hallucinatory predictions the LVLM effectively ignores the image and instead relies on previously generated output (prelim) tokens to infer new objects. We quantify this behavior via the mutual information between the image and the predicted object conditioned on the prelim, demonstrating that weak image dependence strongly correlates with hallucination.

Existing two-stage adaptation methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting their generalization to real-world incompleteness. To overcome these issues, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that reformulates modality missing as a multi-task learning problem. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism: a task-oriented dynamic router that adaptively activates experts for different missing patterns, and a modality-specific-shared static router that maintains stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Unlike prior methods that train separate networks for each missing configuration, MaMOL achieves parameter-efficient adaptation via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates, with minimal computational overhead.

Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities \"think\". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder. Across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models.
