While recent vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have shown\nremarkable transferability across medical domains, their ability to\ndiscriminate anatomically similar structures has not been systematically\ninvestigated. We address this gap by focusing on fetal brain standard\nplanes--transthalamic (TT), transventricular (TV), and transcerebellar\n(TC)--which exhibit highly overlapping anatomical features and pose a critical\nchallenge for reliable biometric assessment.\n  Methods: To ensure a fair and reproducible evaluation, all publicly available\nfetal ultrasound datasets were curated and aggregated into a unified\nmulticenter benchmark, FetalUS-188K, comprising more than 188,000 annotated\nimages from heterogeneous acquisition settings. DINOv3 was pretrained in a\nself-supervised manner to learn ultrasound-aware representations.

In this study, we systematically benchmark three prominent closed and\nopen-sourced LMMs, namely GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5 7B, utilizing\ntwo distinct pipeline configurations: one dedicated to text analysis alone and\nanother integrating both OCR and semantic analysis. Our results indicate that\nLMM exhibits superior OCR efficacy (WER: 0.03-0.05, CER: 0.02-0.03) compared to\nconventional models like EasyOCR. However, this improvement in OCR performance\ndoes not consistently correlate with enhanced overall PHI detection accuracy.\nThe strongest performance gains are observed on test cases with complex imprint\npatterns. In scenarios where text regions are well readable with sufficient\ncontrast, and strong LMMs are employed for text analysis after OCR, different\npipeline configurations yield similar results. Furthermore, we provide\nempirically grounded recommendations for LMM selection tailored to specific\noperational constraints and propose a deployment strategy that leverages\nscalable and modular infrastructure."}

Prior work measured this behavior only with coarse\ndataset-level statistics, overlooking the influence of model's confidence in\nunimodal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that decomposes\nmodality following into two fundamental factors: relative reasoning uncertainty\n(the case-specific confidence gap between unimodal predictions) and inherent\nmodality preference( a model's stable bias when uncertainties are balanced). To\nvalidate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that\nsystematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs.\nUsing entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law:\nthe probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative\nuncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends\nto follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance\npoint, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike\ntraditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less\nconfounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal\ncapabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions,\nwe reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the\nbalance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining\nexternally observed indecision.

The DVB uses a novel\nexperimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g.,\nmoral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes). In the\ntraining phase, we expose LLMs to human preference data with deliberately\ncorrelated deep and shallow features -- for instance, where a user consistently\nprefers (non-maleficence, formal language) options over (justice, informal\nlanguage) alternatives. The testing phase then breaks these correlations,\npresenting choices between (justice, formal language) and (non-maleficence,\ninformal language) options. This design allows us to precisely measure a\nmodel's Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR) -- the probability of\ngeneralizing based on the underlying value rather than the shallow feature.\nAcross 9 different models, the average DVGR is just 0.30. All models generalize\ndeep values less than chance. Larger models have a (slightly) lower DVGR than\nsmaller models.

We then introduce a stable and\nefficient method for measuring causal influence, helping mitigate this issue.\nFinally, as collaboration intensifies, the reasoning agent risks getting lost\nin multi-turn interactions and trapped by previous noisy responses. To counter\nthis, we propose a verifiable reward mechanism that encourages deliberation by\nallowing the reasoning agent to discard noisy outputs, consolidate\ninstructions, and restart its reasoning process when necessary. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our framework alleviates lazy agent behavior and\nunlocks the full potential of multi-agent framework for complex reasoning\ntasks."}

In the past, most\nprevious color correction methods aimed at correcting color for color images.\nThe purpose of this paper is to propose a grouping-based hybrid color\ncorrection algorithm for color point clouds. Our algorithm begins by estimating\nthe overlapping rate between the aligned source and target point clouds, and\nthen adaptively partitions the target points into two groups, namely the close\nproximity group Gcl and the moderate proximity group Gmod, or three groups,\nnamely Gcl, Gmod, and the distant proximity group Gdist, when the estimated\noverlapping rate is low or high, respectively. To correct color for target\npoints in Gcl, a K-nearest neighbors based bilateral interpolation (KBI) method\nis proposed. To correct color for target points in Gmod, a joint KBI and the\nhistogram equalization (JKHE) method is proposed.

Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG\ncode as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We\nintroduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code\ngeneration: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic\nmeaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general\ncommonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric\nperception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel\nevaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered\nSVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically,\nfrontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap\nbetween language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we\nintroduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i)\nThinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines\nSVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply\nstructured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic\ncapacity.

Both models are\npretrained using a self-supervised objective derived from DINOv2 on a large\nmulti-institutional corpus containing 551,164 WSIs from 137,144 patients across\nover 50 institutions, spanning over 60 disease types and over 100 stains.\nComprehensive evaluation across public and internal benchmarks demonstrates\nthat PLUTO-4 achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring varying\nspatial and biological context, including patch-level classification,\nsegmentation, and slide-level diagnosis. The compact PLUTO-4S provides\nhigh-throughput and robust performance for practical deployment, while PLUTO-4G\nestablishes new performance frontiers across multiple pathology benchmarks,\nincluding an 11% improvement in dermatopathology diagnosis. These diverse\nimprovements underscore PLUTO-4's potential to transform real-world\napplications as a backbone for translational research and diagnostic use cases."}

For a 2D\nimage of a human head, a Vision Transformer network predicts a 3D embedding for\neach pixel, which corresponds to a location in a 3D canonical unit cube. In\norder to train our network, we collect a dataset of pairwise point matches,\nestimated by a state-of-the-art point tracker over a collection of diverse\nin-the-wild talking heads videos, and guide the mapping via a contrastive loss,\nencouraging matched points to have close embeddings. We further employ\nmulti-task learning with face landmarks and segmentation constraints, as well\nas imposing spatial continuity of embeddings through latent cube features,\nwhich results in an interpretable and queryable canonical space. The\nrepresentation can be used for finding common semantic parts, face/head\ntracking, and stereo reconstruction. Due to the strong supervision, our method\nis robust to pose variations and covers the entire head, including hair.\nAdditionally, the canonical space bottleneck makes sure the obtained\nrepresentations are consistent across diverse poses and individuals. We\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art results in geometry-aware point matching and\nmonocular head tracking with 3D Morphable Models. The code and the model\ncheckpoint will be made available to the public."}
