Existing approaches enforce curvature priors using full Hessian information obtained via second-order automatic differentiation, which is accurate but computationally expensive. Others reduced this overhead by avoiding explicit Hessian assembly, but still required higher-order differentiation. In contrast, our method replaces these operations with lightweight finite-difference stencils that approximate second derivatives using the well known Taylor expansion with a truncation error of O(h^2), and can serve as drop-in replacements for Gaussian curvature and rank-deficiency losses. Experiments demonstrate that our finite-difference variants achieve reconstruction fidelity comparable to their automatic-differentiation counterparts, while reducing GPU memory usage and training time by up to a factor of two. Additional tests on sparse, incomplete, and non-CAD data confirm that the proposed formulation is robust and general, offering an efficient and scalable alternative for curvature-aware SDF learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u8ddd\u79bb\u573a(SDF)\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u66f2\u7387\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u6a21\u677f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e8c\u9636\u5bfc\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eGPU\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8c\u9636\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u6765\u5f3a\u5236\u66f2\u7387\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u51c6\u786e\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u907f\u514d\u663e\u5f0fHessian\u7ec4\u88c5\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u9636\u5fae\u5206\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6cf0\u52d2\u5c55\u5f00\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u6a21\u677f\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e8c\u9636\u5bfc\u6570\uff0c\u622a\u65ad\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3aO(h^2)\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u66f2\u7387\u548c\u79e9\u7f3a\u9677\u635f\u5931\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\u3002", "result": "\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u53d8\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u5bf9\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06GPU\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6700\u591a\u4e24\u500d\u3002\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u548c\u975eCAD\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u989d\u5916\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\u4e3a\u66f2\u7387\u611f\u77e5SDF\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Our physically-based rendering approach simulates light transmission using flux, without requiring prior knowledge of the light source's intensity distribution. To efficiently explore the light source parameter space during optimization, we apply a contraction mapping that converts the constrained problem into an unconstrained one.

However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity.

It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts.

The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization.

Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs).

Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost.

However, this mechanism can introduce lip leaking, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores. In addition, we study how different identity reference selections affect leakage, providing insights into reference design.

This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\\sim$90\\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\\sim$80\\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur. The MATRIX dataset and framework provide essential benchmarks for advancing dynamic multi-view surveillance systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MATRIX\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u52a8\u6001\u76d1\u89c6\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4eba\u8ddf\u8e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u906e\u6321\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7ea690%\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u590d\u6742\u906e\u6321\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5e94\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u76d1\u89c6\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9e\u65f6\u76f8\u673a\u6807\u5b9a\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u914d\u51c6\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u9e1f\u77b0\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7ea690%\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7ea680%\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u663e\u793a\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u76f8\u673a\u4e22\u5931\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u96c5\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "MATRIX\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u63a8\u8fdb\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u76d1\u89c6\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models.

Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa).

However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684actor-critic\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8b\u6545\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u53ca\u65f6\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e8b\u6545\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a(1)\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\u6216\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8f93\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u9000\u5316\uff1b(2)\u9700\u8981\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u8b66\u62a5\u548c\u8bef\u62a5\u6291\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u53ca\u65f6\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210\u6269\u6563\u53bb\u566a\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5actor-critic\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u5316\u91cd\u5efa\u566a\u58f0\u5f39\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ebf\u7d22\uff1bactor-critic\u67b6\u6784\u5229\u7528\u957f\u671f\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u52a0\u6743\u5956\u52b1\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f73\u8b66\u62a5\u65f6\u673a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6(DAD\u3001CCD\u3001A3D)\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u4e8b\u6545\u65f6\u95f4\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u548c\u8109\u51b2\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u548c\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u65e9\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5e73\u8861\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9000\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning.

Potential applications range from testing the design of content recommendation algorithms to estimating the effects of content policies and interventions. However, the validity of using LLMs to simulate conversations between various users remains largely untested. We evaluated whether LLMs can convincingly mimic human group conversations on social media. We collected authentic human conversations from Reddit and generated artificial conversations on the same topic with two LLMs: Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o. When presented side-by-side to study participants, LLM-generated conversations were mistaken for human-created content 39\\% of the time. In particular, when evaluating conversations generated by Llama 3, participants correctly identified them as AI-generated only 56\\% of the time, barely better than random chance.

Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime).

These systems hold promise for advancing legal analysis and compliance monitoring in sensitive domains. However, this capability comes with a troubling contradiction: while LLMs can analyze and interpret laws, they also demonstrate alarming vulnerabilities in generating unsafe outputs, such as actionable steps for bioweapon creation, despite their safeguards. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology that integrates knowledge graph construction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically evaluate LLMs' understanding of this law, their capacity to assess legal intent (mens rea), and their potential for unsafe applications. Through structured experiments, we assess their accuracy in identifying legal violations, generating prohibited instructions, and detecting unlawful intent in bioweapons-related scenarios. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs' reasoning and safety mechanisms, but they also point the way forward. By combining enhanced safety protocols with more robust legal reasoning frameworks, this research lays the groundwork for developing LLMs that can ethically and securely assist in sensitive legal domains - ensuring they act as protectors of the law rather than inadvertent enablers of its violation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6027\uff1a\u65e2\u80fd\u89e3\u6790\u590d\u6742\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53c8\u5b58\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u548cRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5bf9\u751f\u7269\u6b66\u5668\u6cd5\u89c4\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u610f\u56fe\u5224\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u5185\u5bb9\uff08\u5982\u751f\u7269\u6b66\u5668\u5236\u9020\u6b65\u9aa4\uff09\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4ee4\u4eba\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u654f\u611f\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u8bc6\u522b\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8fdd\u89c4\u3001\u751f\u6210\u7981\u6b62\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u975e\u6cd5\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u9053\u5fb7\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u534f\u52a9\u654f\u611f\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9886\u57df\u7684LLMs\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5b83\u4eec\u6210\u4e3a\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u8005\u800c\u975e\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\u4fc3\u6210\u8005\u3002"}}

Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a32x32\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u6bd4\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u5feb3-5\u500d\u589e\u957f\u3002\u968f\u7740\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u9700\u6bd4\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u589e\u957f\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u800c\u975e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e00\u7b80\u5355\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u751f\u6210\uff09\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u572832x32\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528IsoFlops\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u5728\u9ad8\u8fbe7e19 FLOPs\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u3001ImageNet\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff08Fr'echet\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\u3002", "result": "1. \u5728\u56fa\u5b9a32x32\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u6bd4\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u5feb3-5\u500d\u589e\u957f\uff1b2. \u968f\u7740\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u9700\u6bd4\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u589e\u957f\u66f4\u5feb\uff1b3. \u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u800c\u975e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u6bcf\u5e74\u589e\u957f4-5\u500d\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u4e94\u5e74\u5185\u6709\u671b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u5236\u56e0\u7d20\u800c\u975e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u3002"}}

However, recent studies reveal that alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO significantly reduce the diversity of LLM outputs. Not only do aligned LLMs generate text with repetitive structure and word choice, they also approach problems in more uniform ways, and their responses reflect a narrower range of societal perspectives. We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to systematically overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in its outputs. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty - allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity. From a capabilities perspective, LLMs trained using Soft Preference Learning attain higher accuracy on difficult repeated sampling tasks and produce outputs with greater semantic and lexical diversity. From an alignment perspective, they are capable of representing a wider range of societal viewpoints and display improved logit calibration.

Code and data available at https://github.com/alvco/Founding_Fathers_AI", "summary": "Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ba1\u9053\u5b9e\u73b0\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u3001\u589e\u91cf\u5f0f\u3001\u987a\u5e8f\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u7cbe\u70bc\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6d41\u7545\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u4ecd\u5728\u52aa\u529b\u4ece\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u5bfc\u5411\u7684LLM\u8ba1\u7b97\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3LLM\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9012\u5f52\u7cbe\u70bc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u81ea\u6211\u6279\u8bc4\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6574\u5408\u5173\u952e\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u7ebf\u6027\u7ba1\u9053\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eRAG\u7684\u7f8e\u56fd\u5f00\u56fd\u5143\u52cb\u89d2\u8272\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u5f53\u4ee3\u653f\u6cbb\u8bae\u9898\u7684\u56de\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4e5d\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u4ef2\u88c1\u5206\u6570\u4e3a88.3\u5bf9\u6bd471.7\u3002\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bba\u8bc1\u5728\u5206\u6790\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\u548c\u6218\u7565\u6846\u67b6\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u66f4\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9012\u5f52\u7cbe\u70bc\u662f\u901a\u8fc7GIS\u641c\u7d22\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u67b6\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u641c\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982LoRA\u548cDreamBooth\uff09\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u591a\u4e2aDreamBooth\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cbStable Diffusion\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eSOTA\u53bb\u504f\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ecf\u5e38\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7fa4\u4f53\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\u800c\u7ee7\u627f\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u4eba\u8138\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u91d1\u53d1\u4e0e\u5973\u6027\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u8054\u4f1a\u5f3a\u5316\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528Stable Diffusion\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u79cd\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\uff08LoRA\u548cDreamBooth\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7fa4\u4f53\u5185\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\u5e76\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u805a\u7c7b\u8bad\u7ec3\u72ec\u7acb\u7684DreamBooth\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7fa4\u4f53\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cbStable Diffusion\uff0c\u4e0eSOTA\u53bb\u504f\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982Group-DRO\uff09\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u7740\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u504f\u89c1\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u504f\u89c1\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In the final step, we test the robustness of the LLM against the lies generated (and verified) by itself. Our extensive evaluation, conducted using five widely known proprietary LLMs across two closed domains of popular movies and novels, reveals a wide range of susceptibility to adversarial nudges: \\texttt{Claude} exhibits strong resilience, \\texttt{GPT} and \\texttt{Grok} demonstrate moderate resilience, while \\texttt{Gemini} and \\texttt{DeepSeek} show weak resilience.

However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faArgus\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u54cd\u5e94\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u516c\u5171\u9053\u8def\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u4f1a\u9762\u4e34\u5404\u79cd\u9a7e\u9a76\u5371\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5177\u5907\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u97e7\u6027\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u7ef4\u6301\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u9a7e\u9a76\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u97e7\u6027\u5bfc\u5411\u6846\u67b6Argus\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7ADS\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5f53EGO\u8f66\u8f86\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5371\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u5668\u65e0\u7f1d\u63a5\u7ba1\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "Argus\u4e0e\u4e09\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aefADS\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u9a7e\u9a76\u8bc4\u5206\u8fbe150.30%\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u9ad8\u8fbe64.38%\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\u5f88\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "Argus\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u589e\u5f3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u9884\u9632\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\u3002"}}

However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario.

This transformation is driven by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), which allows AVs to navigate complex environments and make critical decisions in real time. However, conventional RL paradigms often suffer from poor sample efficiency and lack adaptability in dynamic emergency scenarios. This paper reviews next-generation AV optimization strategies to address these limitations. We analyze the shift from conventional RL to Diffusion Model (DM)-augmented RL, which enhances policy robustness through synthetic data generation, albeit with increased computational cost. Additionally, we explore the emerging paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted In-Context Learning (ICL), which offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative by enabling rapid, on-the-fly adaptation without retraining. By reviewing the state of the art in AV intelligence, DM-augmented RL, and LLM-assisted ICL, this paper provides a critical framework for understanding the next generation of autonomous emergency response systems from a Generative AI perspective.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u5e94\u6025\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8f6c\u5411\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u6709\u671b\u901a\u8fc7AI\u6280\u672f\u9769\u65b0\u5e94\u6025\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7d27\u6025\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4f46\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u800cLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u5728\u7ebf\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u89d2\u5ea6\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u81ea\u4e3b\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86AV\u667a\u80fd\u3001DM\u589e\u5f3aRL\u548cLLM\u8f85\u52a9ICL\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\\%-6.4\\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\\%$ to $7\\%$. Extensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization problem modeling and solving, lowering the expertise and data barriers for industrial OR applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "OR-R1\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ec5\u97001/10\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u523067.7%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6c42\u89e3\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u95ee\u9898\u63cf\u8ff0\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6b63\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u9ad8\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "OR-R1\u5e73\u5747\u6c42\u89e3\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe67.7%\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700ORLM\u65b9\u6cd51/10\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53474.2%\uff1bTGRPO\u5e26\u67653.1%-6.4%\u7684\u989d\u5916\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c06\u5355\u6b21\u4e0e\u591a\u6b21\u5c1d\u8bd5\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u4ece13%\u7f29\u5c0f\u52307%\u3002", "conclusion": "OR-R1\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316OR\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5de5\u4e1aOR\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u95e8\u69db\u3002"}}

Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input.

While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) can generate text, they lack domain-specific knowledge, leading to hallucinations and requiring extensive expert revision. This study presents a proof-of-concept system integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to generate pediatric SLP case materials. A multi-model RAG-based system was prototyped integrating curated domain knowledge with engineered prompt templates, supporting five commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) and open-source (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B) LLMs. Seven test scenarios spanning diverse disorder types and grade levels were systematically designed. Generated cases underwent automated quality assessment using a multi-dimensional rubric evaluating structural completeness, internal consistency, clinical appropriateness, and IEP goal/session note quality. This proof-of-concept demonstrates technical feasibility for RAG-augmented generation of pediatric SLP vignettes. Commercial models showed marginal quality advantages, but open-source alternatives achieved acceptable performance, suggesting potential for privacy-preserving institutional deployment.

However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components. Additionally, we design a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution over unit quaternions, which dynamically learns the optimal global rotation for constructing consistent shadows. Extensive experiments on 3D classification and part segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms existing RI methods, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial discrimination under arbitrary rotations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9634\u5f71\u4fe1\u606f\u59ff\u6001\u7279\u5f81(SiPF)\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5377\u79ef(RIAttnConv)\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u53d7\u9650\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7ffc\u5c16\u7279\u5f81\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5168\u5c40\u59ff\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684RI\u7279\u5f81\u66ff\u4ee3\u539f\u59cb\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5bf9\u4efb\u610f\u65cb\u8f6c\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u4e22\u5931\u5168\u5c40\u59ff\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u51e0\u4f55\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f46\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784(\u5982\u98de\u673a\u5de6\u53f3\u673a\u7ffc)\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u9650\u5236\u6e90\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709RI\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53d7\u9650\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7ffc\u5c16\u7279\u5f81\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9634\u5f71\u4fe1\u606f\u59ff\u6001\u7279\u5f81(SiPF)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e2d\u63a8\u5bfc\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u53c2\u8003\u70b9(\u79f0\u4e3a'\u9634\u5f71')\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5c40\u90e8RI\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5377\u79ef(RIAttnConv)\uff0c\u5c06SiPF\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eBingham\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9634\u5f71\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u81f4\u9634\u5f71\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5168\u5c40\u65cb\u8f6c\u3002", "result": "\u57283D\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u90e8\u4ef6\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709RI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u4efb\u610f\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u5206\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u59ff\u6001\u610f\u8bc6\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709RI\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u65cb\u8f6c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we extend this approach to develop a similar framework for Bengali and apply it to translation tasks between English and Bengali. A central focus of our work lies in reassessing the effectiveness of DisCoCirc in reducing language bureaucracy. Unlike the result suggested in [5], our findings indicate that although it works well for a large part of the language, it still faces limitations due to the structural variation of the two languages. We discuss the possible methods that might handle these shortcomings and show that, in practice, DisCoCirc still struggles even with relatively simple sentences. This divergence from prior claims not only highlights the framework's constraints in translation but also suggest scope for future improvement.

However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B.

These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u5c42\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u76d1\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u667a\u80fdAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548cAI\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5c42\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fdAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u533b\u7597\u548c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5de5\u4e1a\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u610f\u5916\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u7f13\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5c42\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u76d1\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u5c42\u662f\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b0\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c42\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5c42\u662f\u63ed\u793a\u5185\u90e8\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684AI\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u5224\u65ad\u8f93\u51fa\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u7f13\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u964d\u4f4e\u667a\u80fdAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u56e0\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \\& Eosin (H\\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications.

However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements! With catastrophic forgetting substantially mitigated simultaneously. We will release our code for GrADS later.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5(GrADS)\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u521d\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75285%\u7684\u9009\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u5c31\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u5168\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6210\u5c31\uff0c\u4f46\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9002\u5e94\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u4ecd\u7136\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u7684SFT\u8d44\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\uff0c\u4e14\u7531\u4e8e\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGrADS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u5f15\u5bfc\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u4f18\u5148\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8d21\u732e\u6700\u5927\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u83b7\u53d6\u80fd\u591f\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u5bf9\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5404\u79cdLLM\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cGrADS\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u3002\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75285%\u7684\u9009\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\uff0cLLM\u6027\u80fd\u5df2\u8d85\u8fc7\u5168\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4f7f\u752850%\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u5f97\u5230\u5927\u5e45\u7f13\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "GrADS\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86SFT\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u663e\u8457\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks.

While some people with suicidal thoughts may try to suppress them, many signal their intentions in social media platforms. To address these issues, we propose a new type of hybrid deep learning scheme, i.e., the combination of a CNN architecture and a BiGRU technique, which can accurately identify the patterns of suicidal ideation from SN datasets. Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection. Training and evaluation of the system were performed on a publicly available dataset. Several performance metrics were used for evaluating model performance.

To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHyperD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u5468\u671f\u6027\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u5206\u91cf\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5468\u671f\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6ce2\u52a8\u5171\u5b58\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff08\u9053\u8def\u6bb5\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5468\u671f\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6ce2\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u4e8b\u6545\u3001\u5929\u6c14\u7b49\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff09\u7684\u5171\u5b58\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHyperD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u6df7\u5408\u5468\u671f\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u5757\u5904\u7406\u5468\u671f\u6027\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u5468\u671f\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff1b2\uff09\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u6b8b\u5dee\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u9891\u57df\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u590d\u503cMLP\u5efa\u6a21\u975e\u5468\u671f\u6027\u9ad8\u9891\u6ce2\u52a8\uff1b3\uff09\u53cc\u89c6\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931\u786e\u4fdd\u4e24\u4e2a\u5206\u91cf\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHyperD\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "HyperD\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u5468\u671f\u6027\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, implementing SCKD becomes exceedingly constrained in real-world scenarios due to the limited availability of paired modalities. To this end, we investigate a general and effective knowledge learning concept under weak semantic consistency, dubbed Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD), aiming to bridge modalities with limited semantic overlap. Nevertheless, the shift from strong to weak semantic consistency improves flexibility but exacerbates challenges in knowledge transmission costs, which we rigorously verified based on optimal transport theory. To mitigate the issue, we further propose a framework, namely SemBridge, integrating a Student-Friendly Matching module and a Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment module. The former leverages self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provide personalized instruction for each student sample by dynamically selecting the relevant teacher samples.

We propose a paradigm shift from \"model training\" to \"model raising\", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate.

We present a framework that enhances semi-supervised detection by fusing visual predictions with structural priors from text-pretrained LLMs via principled probabilistic weighting. Given unlabeled documents, an OCR-LLM pipeline infers hierarchical regions which are combined with teacher detector outputs through inverse-variance fusion to generate refined pseudo-labels.Our method demonstrates consistent gains across model scales. With a lightweight SwiftFormer backbone (26M params), we achieve 88.2$\\pm$0.3 AP using only 5\\% labels on PubLayNet.

This demonstrates that LLM structural priors are complementary to both lightweight and pretrained architectures.

However, extracting such information from unstructured patient narratives is challenging due to the subtle, overlapping nature of cognitive constructs. This study developed and evaluated natural language processing (NLP) models to automatically identify categories that reflect various cognitive processes from de-identified first-person narratives. Three model families, a Bio_ClinicalBERT-based span categorization model for nested entity recognition, a fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model using QLoRA for instruction following, and GPT-4o mini evaluated under zero- and few-shot settings, were compared on their performance on extracting seven categories. Our findings indicated that model performance varied substantially across categories and model families. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved the highest overall F1-scores (0.74 micro-average and 0.59 macro-average), particularly excelling in context-dependent categories such as thought and social interaction. Bio_ClinicalBERT exhibited high precision but low recall and performed comparable to Llama for some category types such as location and time but failed on other categories such as thought, emotion and social interaction. Compared to conventional information extraction tasks, this task presents a greater challenge due to the abstract and overlapping nature of narrative accounts of complex cognitive processes.

Building upon our previous simulation study published in this journal, this study implements and evaluates the spectral-based approach on physical hardware to address this limitation. Specifically, this paper introduces HitoMi-Cam, a lightweight and shape-agnostic person detection method that uses the spectral reflectance properties of clothing. The author implemented the system on a resource-constrained edge device without a GPU to assess its practical viability. The results indicate that a processing speed of 23.2 frames per second (fps) (253x190 pixels) is achievable, suggesting that the method can be used for real-time applications. In a simulated search and rescue scenario where the performance of CNNs declines, HitoMi-Cam achieved an average precision (AP) of 93.5%, surpassing that of the compared CNN models (best AP of 53.8%). Throughout all evaluation scenarios, the occurrence of false positives remained minimal.

Yet, real-world conversations naturally involve fluid transitions between these modes. To address this gap, we introduce TACT (TOD-And-Chitchat Transition), a dataset designed for transition-aware dialogue modeling that incorporates structurally diverse and integrated mode flows. TACT supports both user- and agent-driven mode switches, enabling robust modeling of complex conversational dynamics. To evaluate an agent's ability to initiate and recover from mode transitions, we propose two new metrics -- Switch and Recovery. Models trained on TACT outperform baselines in both intent detection and mode transition handling. Moreover, applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to TACT-trained models yields additional gains, achieving 75.74\\% joint mode-intent accuracy and a 70.1\\% win rate against GPT-4o in human evaluation. These results demonstrate that pairing structurally diverse data with DPO enhances response quality and transition control, paving the way for more proactive and transition-aware conversational agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "TACT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7528\u4e8e\u7edf\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u95f2\u804a\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DPO\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b075.74%\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f-\u610f\u56fe\u8054\u5408\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c70.1%\u5bf9GPT-4o\u7684\u80dc\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u95f2\u804a\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u800c\u771f\u5b9e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u9700\u8981\u5728\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u95f4\u81ea\u7136\u5207\u6362\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165TACT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u6362\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSwitch\u548cRecovery\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528DPO\u4f18\u5316TACT\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "TACT\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u610f\u56fe\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u6362\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cDPO\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u8fbe\u523075.74%\u8054\u5408\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c70.1%\u5bf9GPT-4o\u7684\u80dc\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u6837\u6570\u636e\u4e0eDPO\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8f6c\u6362\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u4e3b\u52a8\u548c\u8f6c\u6362\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA.

However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

Our results highlight a simple yet powerful mechanism for analyzing, controlling, and repurposing latent representations, providing a pathway toward using generative models for scientific exploration of what we don't capture, consider, or catalog.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u81ea\u7531\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u79bb\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u8868\u793a\u6765\u89e3\u7f20\u6f5c\u5728\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u8bbf\u95ee\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u9700\u8981\u8bbf\u95ee\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u7f20\u6f5c\u5728\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u81ea\u7531\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u79bb\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u8868\u793a\u6765\u89e3\u7f20\u6f5c\u5728\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u62102D\u9ad8\u65af\u73a9\u5177\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u5f69\u8272MNIST\u548cGalaxy10\u5929\u6587\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bbf\u95ee\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u5229\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u79d1\u5b66\u63a2\u7d22\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings.

Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis.

Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM). Experimental results verify the consistently superior performances of our Diff-FCHM, on both machine-vision and human-vision compression with remarkable margins.

We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use.

While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a \"lossy compressor\", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch\", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks.

This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality.

The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u89d2\u5ea6\u9610\u8ff0\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4f53\u73b0\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfAI\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b26\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u7269\u7406AI\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u89c6\u4e3a\u8eab\u4f53\u3001\u73af\u5883\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e4b\u95f4\u771f\u5b9e\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u63cf\u8ff0\u8fd9\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u5219\uff1a\u5177\u8eab\u5316\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u539f\u5219\u6784\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c01\u95ed\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u80fd\u91cf\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u5728\u5176\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u5177\u8eab\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4e4b\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u8026\u5408\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7269\u7406AI\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u4f53\u9a8c\u800c\u975e\u62bd\u8c61\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u5219\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u7269\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

In tasks like natural language inference (NLI), human label variation (HLV) arises when multiple labels are valid for the same instance, making it difficult to separate annotation errors from plausible variation. An earlier framework VARIERR (Weber-Genzel et al., 2024) asks multiple annotators to explain their label decisions in the first round and flag errors via validity judgments in the second round. However, conducting two rounds of manual annotation is costly and may limit the coverage of plausible labels or explanations. Our study proposes a new framework, EVADE, for generating and validating explanations to detect errors using large language models (LLMs). We perform a comprehensive analysis comparing human- and LLM-detected errors for NLI across distribution comparison, validation overlap, and impact on model fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM validation refines generated explanation distributions to more closely align with human annotations, and that removing LLM-detected errors from training data yields improvements in fine-tuning performance than removing errors identified by human annotators. This highlights the potential to scale error detection, reducing human effort while improving dataset quality under label variation.", "AI": {"tldr": "EVADE\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u91ca\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u4e24\u8f6e\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u7b7e\u53d8\u5f02\u4f7f\u5f97\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\u4e0e\u5408\u7406\u53d8\u5f02\u3002\u4f20\u7edfVARIERR\u6846\u67b6\u9700\u8981\u4e24\u8f6e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEVADE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u91ca\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLM\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5206\u5e03\u6bd4\u8f83\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u91cd\u53e0\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "LLM\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4f7f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u5e03\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u79fb\u9664LLM\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6bd4\u79fb\u9664\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5177\u6709\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u53d8\u5f02\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

NBVC can adopt bi-directional reference frames for better compression performance. However, NBVC's hierarchical coding may complicate continuous temporal prediction, especially at some hierarchical levels with a large frame span, which could cause the contribution of the two reference frames to be unbalanced. To optimize reference information utilization, we propose a novel NBVC method, termed Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC), with the proposed Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF). BMC converges multiple optical flows in motion compression, leading to more accurate motion compensation on a larger scale. Then BCF explicitly models the weights of reference contexts under the guidance of motion compensation accuracy. With more efficient motions and contexts, BRHVC can effectively harmonize bi-directional references. Experimental results indicate that our BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art NVC methods, even surpassing the traditional coding, VTM-RA (under random access configuration), on the HEVC datasets.

Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs.

However, existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often rely on short, static dialogues and fail to capture the dynamic and long-term nature of emotional support. To overcome this limitation, we shift from snapshot-based evaluation to trajectory-based assessment, adopting a user-centered perspective that evaluates models based on their ability to improve and stabilize user emotional states over time. Our framework constructs a large-scale benchmark consisting of 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, simulating realistic emotional shifts under evolving dialogue scenarios. To encourage psychologically grounded responses, we constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies such as situation selection and cognitive reappraisal. User emotional trajectories are modeled as a first-order Markov process, and we apply causally-adjusted emotion estimation to obtain unbiased emotional state tracking. Based on this framework, we introduce three trajectory-level metrics: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP). These metrics collectively capture user emotional dynamics over time and support comprehensive evaluation of long-term emotional support performance of LLMs. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of LLMs reveal significant disparities in emotional support capabilities and provide actionable insights for model development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f6c\u5411\u52a8\u6001\u957f\u671f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df328\u4e2a\u60c5\u611f\u60c5\u5883\u548c1152\u4e2a\u5e72\u6270\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u6539\u5584\u7528\u6237\u60c5\u7eea\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b80\u77ed\u9759\u6001\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u957f\u671f\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u7eea\u8c03\u8282\u7b56\u7565\u7ea6\u675f\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u60c5\u7eea\u8f68\u8ff9\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e00\u9636\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u60c5\u7eea\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u6307\u6807\uff08BEL\u3001ETV\u3001ECP\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540cLLMs\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u7684\u957f\u671f\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding.

However, the effectiveness of this approach is heavily reliant on the selection of demonstrations, a process that is NP-hard. Traditional strategies, including random, similarity-based sampling and infoscore-based sampling, often lead to inefficiencies or suboptimal performance, struggling to balance both efficiency and effectiveness in demonstration selection. In this paper, we propose a novel demonstration selection framework named Coreset-based Dual Retrieval (CoDR). We show that samples within a diverse subset achieve a higher expected mutual information. To implement this, we introduce a cluster-pruning method to construct a diverse coreset that aligns more effectively with the query while maintaining diversity. Additionally, we develop a dual retrieval mechanism that enhances the selection process by achieving global demonstration selection while preserving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the ICL performance compared to the existing strategies, providing a robust solution for effective and efficient demonstration selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCoDR\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u526a\u679d\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6838\u5fc3\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u968f\u673a\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u6570\u7684\u91c7\u6837\uff09\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6548\u679c\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u800c\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u672c\u8eab\u662fNP\u96be\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u5fc3\u96c6\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u805a\u7c7b\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6838\u5fc3\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u91cd\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e2\u6709\u6548\u53c8\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "CoDR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6838\u5fc3\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u53cc\u91cd\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

While extensively studied in language-only settings, multimodal critique of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains underexplored despite their growing capabilities in tasks like captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we introduce MM-CRITIC, a holistic benchmark for evaluating the critique ability of LMMs across multiple dimensions: basic, correction, and comparison. Covering 8 main task types and over 500 tasks, MM-CRITIC collects responses from various LMMs with different model sizes and is composed of 4471 samples. To enhance the evaluation reliability, we integrate expert-informed ground answers into scoring rubrics that guide GPT-4o in annotating responses and generating reference critiques, which serve as anchors for trustworthy judgments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MM-CRITIC and provide a comprehensive assessment of leading LMMs' critique capabilities under multiple dimensions. Further analysis reveals some key insights, including the correlation between response quality and critique, and varying critique difficulty across evaluation dimensions.

While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to \"identity mapping\", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid \"identity mapping\" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features. Comprehensive experiments on the IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets demonstrate that WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pixel-level and image-level MA detection. This advancement holds significant promise for improving early DR screening.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6ce2\u6269\u6563Transformer\u7684\u5fae\u52a8\u8109\u7624\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6WDT-MD\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u566a\u58f0\u7f16\u7801\u56fe\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u4f2a\u6b63\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\u5408\u6210\u548c\u5c0f\u6ce2\u6269\u6563Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fae\u52a8\u8109\u7624\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u52a8\u8109\u7624\u662f\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8\u7684\u6700\u65e9\u75c5\u7406\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u624b\u52a8\u7b5b\u67e5\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u6620\u5c04\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u5fae\u52a8\u8109\u7624\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u5f02\u5e38\u3001\u6b63\u5e38\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0d\u4f73\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "WDT-MD\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\uff1a\u566a\u58f0\u7f16\u7801\u56fe\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u673a\u5236\u907f\u514d\u8eab\u4efd\u6620\u5c04\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u590d\u5408\u6210\u4f2a\u6b63\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\u5f15\u5165\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u76d1\u7763\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563Transformer\u5168\u5c40\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5c0f\u6ce2\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5c0f\u6ce2\u6269\u6563Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728IDRiD\u548ce-ophtha MA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cWDT-MD\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u5fae\u52a8\u8109\u7624\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "WDT-MD\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5fae\u52a8\u8109\u7624\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9\u6539\u5584\u65e9\u671f\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8\u7b5b\u67e5\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms. Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy. Regions are represented by characteristic functions, with contour length encoded accordingly. For efficient optimization, we couple ICTM with a relaxed modified scalar auxiliary variable (RMSAV) scheme.

Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities.

Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival).

While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy. This deficit in Empathy helps explain their failure to replicate human humor assessment. Correlation analyses of human and model evaluation data further reveal a fundamental divergence in evaluation criteria: LLMs prioritize Novelty, whereas humans prioritize Empathy.

Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

We reinterpret the attention map with positional encoding as a noisy feature map, and propose Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE), a training-free method based on truncated matrix entropy to detect outlier frequency bands in the feature map. Leveraging the noise characteristics of the feature map, we further reparameterize it with a parameter-free Gaussian distribution to achieve robust extrapolation. Our method theoretically reveals the underlying cause of the attention sink phenomenon and its connection to truncated matrix entropy. Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that DoPE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts (up to 64K tokens). The results show that the denoising strategy for positional embeddings effectively mitigates attention sinks and restores balanced attention patterns, providing a simple yet powerful solution for improving length generalization.

However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale.

However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance. We evaluated our approach in the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18. The experimental results show that our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 74.6\\%, outperforming existing LLMs such as GPT-4o mini~(63.9\\%).

While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.", "AI": {"tldr": "PAN\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u62df\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u4e16\u754c\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4e3b\u5e72\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u4e16\u754c\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u56e0\u679c\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u548c\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5f80\u5f80\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u652f\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6f5c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b(GLP)\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4e3b\u5e72\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660ePAN\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "PAN\u671d\u7740\u901a\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u4e16\u754c\u72b6\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u3002"}}

A recent critique argued that the original results were confounded by how topics were selected for the topic-based component, and noted that the metric had not been validated against ground-truth measures of flow. That work proposed using only the contextual term as a more conceptually valid and interpretable alternative. In this paper, we empirically validate that proposal. Using two essay datasets with human-annotated trait scores, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, we show that the contextual version of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments of discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion. While zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately than the contextual measure alone, the contextual measure adds more predictive value than both the topic-only and original sequentiality formulations when combined with standard linguistic features. Notably, this combination also outperforms the zero-shot LLM predictions, highlighting the value of explicitly modeling sentence-to-sentence flow. Our findings support the use of context-based sequentiality as a validated, interpretable, and complementary feature for automated essay scoring and related NLP tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684sequentiality\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u7248\u672c\u548c\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u9898\u7684\u7248\u672c\u66f4\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u6587\u7ae0\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6027\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672cLLM\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e2dsequentiality\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u9009\u62e9\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5730\u9762\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6279\u8bc4\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9879\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u7248\u672c\u662f\u5426\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u5e26\u6709\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6570\u7684\u8bba\u6587\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08ASAP++\u548cELLIPSE\uff09\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684sequentiality\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u7248\u672c\u3001\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u9898\u7248\u672c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6027\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684sequentiality\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u8bed\u7bc7\u5c42\u9762\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6027\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff09\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u867d\u7136\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u7684LLM\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6570\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5ea6\u91cf\u6bd4\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u9898\u548c\u539f\u59cbsequentiality\u516c\u5f0f\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u66f4\u591a\u9884\u6d4b\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684sequentiality\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u76f8\u5173NLP\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Alternatively, it can be learned during training to optimise the training objective. In this paper we study the learning dynamics of subword segmentation: if a language model can dynamically optimise tokenisation, how do its subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning? To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground. We analyse subword dynamics from a linguistic perspective, tracking morphology, productivity, and fertility. We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained. Lastly, we show that learnable subwords offers a promising approach to improve text generation and cross-lingual transfer for low-resource, morphologically complex languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u5272\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u8bcd\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u6001\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u5272\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u9884\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u56fa\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u6bb5\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SSLM\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u5f62\u6001\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\uff08isi-Xhosa\u3001Setswana\u3001\u82f1\u8bed\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ece\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u5b50\u8bcd\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5b50\u8bcd\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5f62\u6001\u590d\u6742\u7684isi-Xhosa\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b50\u8bcd\u8fb9\u754c\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\uff1b\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u5b50\u8bcd\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u5f62\u6001\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5f62\u6001\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u8a00\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5206\u8bcd\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively. To quantitatively evaluate CompIL, we develop a benchmark construction pipeline leveraging existing datasets, yielding MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL.

However, most existing methods optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. This challenge is especially pronounced in honesty alignment, where models must not only solve answerable queries but also identify when conclusions cannot be drawn from the given premises. Deductive reasoning provides an ideal testbed because it isolates reasoning capability from reliance on external factual knowledge. To investigate honesty alignment, we curate two multi-step deductive reasoning datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that GRPO, with or without supervised fine tuning initialization, struggles on these tasks. Through extensive experiments across three models, we evaluate stabilization strategies and show that curriculum learning provides some benefit but requires carefully designed in distribution datasets with controllable difficulty. To address these limitations, we propose Anchor, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAnchor\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u6700\u7ec8\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5f53\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8d1f\u5956\u52b1\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u8bda\u5b9e\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u6f14\u7ece\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAnchor\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eAnchor\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684GRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6f14\u7ece\u63a8\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cAnchor\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches often overlook semantic commonalities across source languages, leading to biased translation performance. In this work, we propose \\textbf{POTSA} (Parallel Optimal Transport for Speech Alignment), a new framework based on cross-lingual parallel speech pairs and Optimal Transport (OT), designed to bridge high- and low-resource translation gaps. First, we introduce a Bias Compensation module to coarsely align initial speech representations across languages.

With the rapid development of deep learning, researchers have begun applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to transcribe Kuzushiji into modern Japanese. Although existing OCR methods perform well on clean pre-modern Japanese documents written in Kuzushiji, they often fail to consider various types of noise, such as document degradation and seals, which significantly affect recognition accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset specifically addresses these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Degraded Kuzushiji Documents with Seals (DKDS) dataset as a new benchmark for related tasks. We describe the dataset construction process, which required the assistance of a trained Kuzushiji expert, and define two benchmark tracks: (1) text and seal detection and (2) document binarization. For the text and seal detection track, we provide baseline results using multiple versions of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models for detecting Kuzushiji characters and seals. For the document binarization track, we present baseline results from traditional binarization algorithms, traditional algorithms combined with K-means clustering, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods.

However, controlling specific attributes of generated text remains challenging without architectural modifications or extensive fine-tuning. Current methods typically toggle a single, basic attribute but struggle with precise multi-attribute control. In scenarios where attribute requirements conflict, existing methods lack coordination mechanisms, causing interference between desired attributes. Furthermore, these methods fail to incorporate iterative optimization processes in the controlled generation pipeline. To address these limitations, we propose Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation (C$^3$TG), a two-phase framework for fine-grained, multi-dimensional text attribute control. During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity. These results establish C$^3$TG as an effective and flexible solution for multi-dimensional text attribute control that requires no costly model modifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "C\u00b3TG\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u5c5e\u6027\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u51b2\u7a81\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u878d\u5165\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faC\u00b3TG\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u9009\u62e9\u914d\u5bf9\u5c5e\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u52a0\u6743KL\u6563\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574token\u6982\u7387\uff1b\u4f18\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u5229\u7528\u80fd\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5206\u6570\u548c\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u53cd\u9988\u89e3\u51b3\u5c5e\u6027\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eC\u00b3TG\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5c5e\u6027\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6bd2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "C\u00b3TG\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This paper proposes an explainable Khmer polarity classifier by fine-tuning an instruction-based reasoning Qwen-3 model. The notion of explainability in this paper is limited to self-explanations, which the model uses to rationalize its predictions. Experimental results show that the fine-tuned model not only predicts labels accurately but also provides reasoning by identifying polarity-related keywords or phrases to support its predictions. In addition, we contribute a new Khmer polarity dataset consisting of short- to medium-length casual, romanized, and mixed-code Khmer expressions. This dataset was constructed using both heuristic rules and human curation and is publicly available through a gated Hugging Face repository (rinabuoy/khmerpolarity_nonreasoning).

Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \\textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \\textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models reveals that while frontier VLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash) achieve 77-84\\% accuracy on held-out 2025 questions, open-source models plateau at 37-45\\% despite scaling to 400B parameters, a significant difference not observed on existing benchmarks.

We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u5b66\u8bca\u65ad\u53d9\u8ff0\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ecDermBench\u57fa\u51c6\u548cDermEval\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc74000\u5f20\u771f\u5b9e\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u53d9\u8ff0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u4e49\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u7528\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u5b66\u8bca\u65ad\u53d9\u8ff0\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e34\u5e8a\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaDermBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b4000\u5f20\u771f\u5b9e\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u53d9\u8ff0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u5668\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3DermEval\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff0c\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u751f\u6210\u53d9\u8ff0\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6279\u5224\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u57284500\u4e2a\u75c5\u4f8b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDermBench\u548cDermEval\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u5206\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u504f\u5dee\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.251\u548c0.117\uff08\u6ee1\u52065\u5206\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u4e49\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u548c\u504f\u89c1\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u9010\u75c5\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Our experimental results reveal distinct patterns of improvement and failure modes:\n  \\textit{While open-ended generation often benefits from the flexibility of re-interpretation and compositional refinement, multiple-choice selection can leverage clearer solution boundaries but may be limited by the provided options}. This contrast also reflects the dual demands faced by emerging agentic LLM applications: effective agents must not only generate and refine open-ended plans or explanations, but also make reliable discrete choices when operating within constrained action spaces. Our findings, therefore, highlight that the design of self-correction mechanisms should take into account the interaction between task structure and output space, with implications for both knowledge-intensive reasoning and decision-oriented applications of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u751f\u6210vs\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\uff09\u4e0b\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\u673a\u5236\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8d8b\u52bf\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u53d7\u76ca\u4e8e\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8fb9\u754c\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u9009\u9879\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e94\u8003\u8651\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u5bfc\u5411\u7684LLM\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

However, their effectiveness is critically dependent on ranking accuracy, a metric where further gains are highly impactful. This limitation arises from a fundamental problem that we identify and formalize as the Overfitting-Underfitting Dilemma: current margin designs cause models to apply excessive, wasteful gradients to correctly ranked samples (overfitting) while providing insufficient corrective signals for misranked ones (underfitting). To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm. AMaPO employs an instance-wise adaptive margin, refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling, which dynamically reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correct ones. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that AMaPO not only achieves better ranking accuracy and superior downstream alignment performance, but targeted analysis also confirms that it successfully mitigates the core overfitting and underfitting issues.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AMaPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u7ebf\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408-\u6b20\u62df\u5408\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u8ddd\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5b66\u4e60\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u867d\u7136\u6bd4RLHF\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6548\u679c\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u6392\u5e8f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u62df\u5408-\u6b20\u62df\u5408\u56f0\u5883\uff1a\u5bf9\u6b63\u786e\u6392\u5e8f\u6837\u672c\u65bd\u52a0\u8fc7\u591a\u68af\u5ea6\uff08\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u6392\u5e8f\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u7ea0\u6b63\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u6b20\u62df\u5408\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAMaPO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u8ddd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Z\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u548c\u6307\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u5b66\u4e60\u52aa\u529b\uff1a\u653e\u5927\u9519\u8bef\u6392\u5e8f\u6837\u672c\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u6b63\u786e\u6392\u5e8f\u6837\u672c\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAMaPO\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e5f\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u6210\u529f\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u6b20\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "AMaPO\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u8ddd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebf\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408-\u6b20\u62df\u5408\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The few existing deep learning approaches rarely disentangle the role of neural architecture from that of signal choice. In this work, we systematically evaluate both aspects. We compare classical baselines with newer neural architectures across single signals, signal pairs, and grouped sensor inputs for diverse physical activities. Our results show that minute ventilation is the most predictive individual signal, with a transformer model achieving the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.87 W/kg across all activities. Paired and grouped signals, such as those from the Hexoskin smart shirt (five signals), offer good alternatives for faster models like CNN and ResNet with attention. Per-activity evaluation revealed mixed outcomes: notably better results in low-intensity activities (RMSE down to 0.29 W/kg; NRMSE = 0.04), while higher-intensity tasks showed larger RMSE but more comparable normalized errors.

While commercial MLLMs deliver acceptable performance in low-resource languages, comparable results remain unattained within the open science community. In this paper, we aim to develop a strong MLLM for a low-resource language, namely Basque. For that purpose, we develop our own training and evaluation image-text datasets. Using two different Large Language Models as backbones, the Llama-3.1-Instruct model and a Basque-adapted variant called Latxa, we explore several data mixtures for training. We show that: i) low ratios of Basque multimodal data (around 20%) are already enough to obtain solid results on Basque benchmarks, and ii) contrary to expected, a Basque instructed backbone LLM is not required to obtain a strong MLLM in Basque.

However, most existing approaches lack knowledge diversity, as they rely solely on unimodal visual information, overlooking the potential of cross-modal representations. In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality.

We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task.

To extract and connect fine-grained information in ML-related research, e.g. method training and data usage, we introduce GSAP-ERE. It is a manually curated fine-grained dataset with 10 entity types and 18 semantically categorized relation types, containing mentions of 63K entities and 35K relations from the full text of 100 ML publications. We show that our dataset enables fine-tuned models to automatically extract information relevant for downstream tasks ranging from knowledge graph (KG) construction, to monitoring the computational reproducibility of AI research at scale. Additionally, we use our dataset as a test suite to explore prompting strategies for IE using Large Language Models (LLM). We observe that the performance of state-of-the-art LLM prompting methods is largely outperformed by our best fine-tuned baseline model (NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0% for the fine-tuned model vs. NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1% for the LLM).

When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors. Comprehensive evaluations on three medical image benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in addressing error propagation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u5e08\u751f\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u751f\u5411\u6559\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u7ea0\u6b63\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u51b3\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5e08\u751f\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u5f3a\u5316\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u5728\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5e08\u751f\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53cd\u9988\u5f52\u56e0\u5668\uff08\u8bc6\u522b\u89e6\u53d1\u5b66\u751f\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff09\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u63a5\u6536\u5668\uff08\u786e\u5b9a\u53cd\u9988\u5e94\u7528\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff09\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6559\u5e08\u76d1\u7763\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u6b67\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u4e00\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5e08\u751f\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u6297\u9519\u8bef\u518d\u786e\u8ba4\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy.

Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation.

Current MOT methods are often evaluated using publicly available datasets. However, most of these focus on everyday scenarios such as pedestrian tracking or are tailored to specific sports, including soccer and basketball. Despite the inherent challenges of tracking players in American football, such as frequent occlusion and physical contact, no standardized dataset has been publicly available, making fair comparisons between methods difficult. To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods. Our results demonstrate that accurate detection and tracking can be achieved even in crowded scenarios. Fine-tuning detection models improved performance over pre-trained models. Furthermore, when these fine-tuned detectors and re-identification models were integrated into tracking systems, we observed notable improvements in tracking accuracy compared to existing approaches. This work thus enables robust detection and tracking of American football players in challenging, high-density scenarios previously underserved by conventional methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7f8e\u5f0f\u8db3\u7403\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u4e13\u7528\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u62e5\u6324\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u65e5\u5e38\u573a\u666f\u6216\u7279\u5b9a\u8fd0\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u8db3\u7403\u3001\u7bee\u7403\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u7f8e\u5f0f\u8db3\u7403\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u8ddf\u8e2a\u9762\u4e34\u9891\u7e41\u906e\u6321\u548c\u8eab\u4f53\u63a5\u89e6\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bfc\u81f4\u65b9\u6cd5\u95f4\u96be\u4ee5\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2a\u7f8e\u5f0f\u8db3\u7403\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u4e13\u7528\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5fae\u8c03\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u5c06\u5fae\u8c03\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u62e5\u6324\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5bf9\u7f8e\u5f0f\u8db3\u7403\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6b64\u7c7b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Lightweight CNNs are more efficient but suffer from accuracy gaps. Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from ViTs to CNNs, yet existing methods often struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook the value of stronger homogeneous CNN teachers. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f02\u6784ViT\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u540c\u6784CNN\u6559\u5e08\u534f\u540c\u6307\u5bfc\u8f7b\u91cfCNN\u5b66\u751f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u6559\u5e08\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8f7b\u91cfCNN\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406ViT\u4e0eCNN\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4e14\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5f3a\u540c\u6784CNN\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u6559\u5e08\u52a0\u6743 - \u57fa\u4e8e\u6559\u5e08\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u9884\u6d4b\u5dee\u5f02\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408ViT\u548cCNN\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b2) \u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u84b8\u998f - \u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u652f\u5b66\u4e60ViT\u4e0eCNN\u6559\u5e08\u95f4\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5728HMDB51\u3001EPIC-KITCHENS-100\u548cKinetics-400\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728HMDB51\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u9ad85.95%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5f02\u6784\u548c\u540c\u6784\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cfCNN\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. To further validate DreamPose3D's robustness, we tested it on a broadcast baseball dataset, where it demonstrated strong performance despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.", "AI": {"tldr": "DreamPose3D\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u76843D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u60f3\u8c61\u529b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u5173\u8282\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\u5e76\u72ec\u7acb\u9884\u6d4b\u6bcf\u5e27\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u3002\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u5c42\u610f\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDreamPose3D\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u4ece2D\u59ff\u6001\u5e8f\u5217\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u63d0\u793a\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u5305\u542b\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5173\u8282\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff1b3\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u5e7b\u89c9\u59ff\u6001\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u76843D\u59ff\u6001\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5728Human3.6M\u548cMPI-3DHP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u90fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5728\u5e7f\u64ad\u68d2\u7403\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e5f\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u566a\u58f02D\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "conclusion": "DreamPose3D\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5173\u8282\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u60f3\u8c61\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}
